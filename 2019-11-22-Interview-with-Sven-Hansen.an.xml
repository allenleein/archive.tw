                    <p>
                        To be honest, I was a bit astonished that your press secretary asked for the subjects I would be talking. [laughs]

                        Yeah, it’s OK. I know how to handle it. [laughs] I think you as well. I’ll just start it now. OK, it goes.

                    <p>
                        I understand your job description is minister of digital affairs in Taiwan. Your job is to make the democratically elected government as transparent as possible…

                    <p>
                        To the people. This seems to be exactly the opposite of what is happening in China.

                    <p>
                        You mean they’re making people transparent to the state?

                    <p>
                        Wow. Who would have done that?

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        The regime has the opposite aim of using digitalization for the benefit of the regime for making the people as transparent as possible. I wonder, is Taiwan is under threat from China – from mainland China – politically…also, military threats? Do you see limits of transparency in Taiwan?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        I mean, your president yesterday or the day before said every day, China is somehow meddling in Taiwan. Are there limits to transparency in Taiwan?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Making the state transparent to the people is what every liberal democracy should aspire to. The previous restrictions is not so much philosophical, but rather technology. For example, we have now the technology that turns whatever we are talking into text and translate it immediately.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Before, you have to hire people to type and to translate it, and that precludes a lot of transparency if you speak a different language, for example. Inclusion, I think, is not something that people dispute in liberal democracies. It’s just that we’re working to reduce the cost in the bureaucracy to be as transparent as possible.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        As for the limits, of course, just like in every country with Freedom of Information Act, the things concerning the state secret, as well as privacy, are off limits to the transparency of the freedom of information law, and Taiwan is no different.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For example, in our meetings, where we publish the entire transcript of all the meeting that I am the chair, I am not livestreaming everything, because that would invade the privacy part, but we publish the transcript only after 10 working day of co-editing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        So if you accidentally tell about anecdote of some third party that is not ready to publish their anecdote, you can anonymize it or something. This is all a very humane way of looking at how we meet and how we make contributions to the public discourse together.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        My point of radical transparency, it’s not 100 percent transparency. It’s rather transparency at the root, as the default. It takes extra effort to edit parts out, but if you don’t do anything, it will go out by default, and that is the kind of radical transparency that I promote.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        You don’t see the danger of China misusing your transparency somewhat?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I don’t see any danger because all of the meetings that I hold, whether it’s around open government, social innovation or youth engagement, we want everybody to know as much as possible because disinformation or information operation is not actually to get somebody elected or somebody not elected.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It is actually to sow discord and make people distrust democracy itself, to make people distrust democratic conversations, to mobilize the outrage of people against one another so that the polity cannot be formed anymore extremist politics.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Our radical transparency serve as antidote because people know the context, the why of policy-making, why we are talking about this, why we’re not doing this, why we are doing this. We share the bad news and we share the good news. If we only say the good news like in a propaganda, people don’t trust us, and they shouldn’t.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s only when we trust the people with all the good news and bad news do people actually understand that we are in a democracy, in a polity. In that sense, the democratic spirit is strong and it’s becoming much harder for somebody working on propaganda to sow discord.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If we publish only intermittently and only good news, it is excellent fertile ground for people to do disinformation campaigns.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        Right next door to Taiwan, in Hong Kong, there’s a struggle about trust at the moment. We see a leaderless mass movement organized mostly over the Internet for more than five months now. How does this struggle in Hong Kong affect Taiwan?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        First of all, in Taiwan, we are seeing the Hong Kong people looking to further liberal democracy that was promised to them when they first entered this arrangement with the PRC, and so we see that these demonstrations, they’re really demo, as in showing that it is possible for them to self-govern, even in very adverse scenarios, to coordinate their own behavior.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is what self-governance means. We, of course, are sad to see the escalation of violence over the past few weeks. Taiwanese universities are already offering exchange programs so that the students there can visit Taiwan.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Some universities are even covering the boarding, the tuition, and things like that, so that they can have some resting place, a safe place, where they can talk to, for example, Reporters Without Borders, which has a headquarter in Taiwan in Taipei, and the Oslo Freedom Forum, of course, and many other like-minded countries that really want to have a conversation, but in a safe place with the students.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think we are supporting them inasmuch as the university is willing to do so. Also, it’s very important to note that the Taiwanese election, the presidential election, all the three presidential candidates all support the fifth demand in the cause to get Hong Kong into general elections.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        In Hong Kong, the protests are also about the principle of one country, two systems, which originally was designed for attracting Taiwan. Has this principle failed now?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The only thing I can say about the three presidential candidates is that none of them endorse this platform. All of them are actually against – sometime very verbally – this platform. Obviously, there is no presidential candidate in Taiwan that takes a liking to “one country, two systems.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Sven Hansen">
                    <p>
                        Do you think that the protests in Hong Kong are helping your current president – I mean Tsai Ing-wen – and your government at the moment getting reelected? Is it, let’s say, yeah, helping you getting reelected, as it shows the true face of China?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think Dr. Tsai’s position on either “one country, two systems” or Hong Kong has been very consistent. That is the strength of Dr. Tsai Ing-wen’s foreign policy, is that she is very stable and extremely reliable.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I guess I’m happy to see that other presidential candidates are now adopting a very similar platform. That’s my answer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You are quoted as having said that, “It is urgent to think democratically…” Sorry. Your quote was, “It is urgent to think democracy digitally new.” What do you mean by that? Can you give us an example?

                    <p>
                        OK. Yes, I did say that. I think what I mean is that previously, with radio and television, it’s very easy to speak to a million people, but it was not possible to listen to a million people. It was not possible for a million people to listen to one another.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That material difference between broadcasting and listening defined a lot of the way how democracy is conducting itself. Nowadays, with the capacity to listen to millions of people, we can do, for example, massive consultations that used to be very expensive. We can do it every day.

                    <p>
                        What used to be very hard…For example, every four years, you go to the voting booth, it’s quite a trip. People feel distance, because there’s only every two years or every four year can they express their ideas about public participation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, you can use participatory budgeting. You can use petitioning. You can use sandboxes, Presidential Hackathon in Taiwan, and things like that to make sure that people can participate in democratic process every day.

                    <p>
                        Because of that, we can also include people. For example, a lot of petitions in Taiwan are done by people around 16 years old.

                        They are not of legal age to vote in referendum or in elections, but they have the best ideas. For example, banning plastic straws and replacing them carbon-neutral organic materials that are circular economy.

                        They care more about the planet and their future, because they will be on the receiving end of climate change. They have a lot of very interesting ideas. By designing democracy using digital participation, we make sure that people who are 15, who are 16, can also participate fully in the agenda-setting part without having to go to, I don’t know, street on Fridays.

                    <p>
                        We use two ways. First, we work with the telecoms so that you have to be a Taiwan resident, using a Taiwan SMS phone number to verify your account. That account system only tells the ministries whether they live in which region, but do not disclose exactly the name, or the phone number, or anything private about them.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It is just a way to authenticate that you are really a Taiwan resident. The second, we make sure that all the e-petitions and so on are only done to set the agenda of face-to-face conversations. In design thinking terms, it is about discovering and defining the problem. It is not about developing delivering, like in referendums.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our e-participation only takes the agenda-setting part and never the binding part, like competing with the parliament. Because of that, it really doesn’t pay exponentially to game the system. For example, if you want to purchase 5,000 SIM cards, you can probably legally do that, even though the money laundering counter-unit will probably [laughs] discover that very quickly.

                        Your point is well-taken. For things like petitioning, which is agenda-setting, we may use SMS. For really bylaw, like referendum, collecting signature for referendum, we use the state-issued EID card. That EID card is independent of any telecom company, because it has a legally-binding power for electronic signatures.

                        That would be my other question, that companies like Google or Facebook, that they are so dominating. They have such a strong monopoly. On the other hand, they are hardly paying any taxes. They are more and more seen as a danger to democracy and privacy rights.

                        Facebook is selling basically advertisements. That is their main business model, and they, because of advertisers want people to look at their messages more, they also sell addiction as a by-product so that people gets more and more addicted to their product and therefore see more advertisements.

                        I think any addictive substance, I mean, I just drank some coffee, so I shouldn’t really say bad things about addiction. [laughs] I also drink coffee every morning, but I think it is the civil society’s duty to remind one another that caffeine overdose also has its drawbacks, that we need to understand what caffeine does to our body, and that we don’t fall into even more addictive stimulants and things like that.

                        I think as with any addictive substance, proper education is very important because, for example, in my primary school, because I dropped out of junior high, but I remember in primary school, I learnt that caffeine is no substitute for sleeping, and so if you feel sleepy, you should not drink caffeine. You should get to sleep. Otherwise, it destroys your sleeping pattern.

                        As a government to a governor of overlapping jurisdictions, I think it’s very important to act diplomatically, and the diplomacy here is to set a norm to first talk to the constituents in a society – say, in Taiwan – and understand what people expect as the norm.

                    <p>
                        For example, when Uber entered Taiwan, the norm that we listened at scale, using AI conversation, was that people expect them to be subject to the same taxation, to the same permits and licenses, and the same registration as taxis.

                        That is what we then negotiated with Uber. You can use Uber now in Taiwan, but all you call are multi-purpose taxis. The taxi companies are also developing their own Uber-like apps. That is the consensus of the society.

                        Just like with political elections, and as you said, Facebook versus democracy, the norm in Taiwan is that we have a separate branch of the government, the Control Yuan, that looks at all the campaign donations and now disclose each and every record, completely publicly, making sure only natural citizens in Taiwan and local people can donate to campaign donation.

                        That it’s independently verified by all the investigative journalist and data scientists. That is the norm in Taiwan for campaign donation. We are saying to Facebook, Google, and everybody else that this is the norm in Taiwan.

                        You can either, in your platform, when people pay you to advertise political messages, you can either treat it exactly as the campaign donation…That is to say, review everything, making sure only natural citizens in Taiwan can donate, and penalize people who act as foreign proxies.

                        “If you don’t do so, then I’m afraid that there will be social sanction from our population.” We’re not jumping to make laws about that. We’re saying that this is the norm around here. Facebook say, “OK, we will disclose to exactly the same standard as you do on campaign donation.” Twitter and Facebook say, “OK, we will just not run political advertisements.”

                        If I understand it correctly, that there is, for example, no law against hate speech, so it’s up to the company and up to the constituency to call hate speech a hate speech. It’s not that Facebook has to follow certain rules set by you, but it’s up to Facebook to react?

                        For example, my mother, she is not able to use the Internet. What are you doing against this division of society, of exclusion of elderly people? Some type of discrimination as well, if you strongly focus so much on digitalization. What are you doing against this danger of discrimination against elderly people?

                        First of all, the research shows that in Taiwan, the disconnect, as you mentioned, only starts around 75 years old. Actually, the 65-years-olds are one of the most active groups in digital participation, so maybe it’s not exactly the same as in Germany.

                        In Taiwan, just this year, we switched from having only one national language to about 20 national languages. All of these languages, including the sign language, also need to be enabled and empowered, and machine translation and things like that is very important to deliver on this promise.

                        It’s just empowering people to understand that if you can make anything appear on the screen, if you know how to program, if you learn Scratch or something, you see it as the illusion that it is.

                        Only when people don’t know the logic behind the screen do people project the screen as something magical, and so if you know how to program, at least a little bit, then the illusion disappears. You know that these are just pixels that you can make appear any time and so you become less addicted. It’s true. It’s called disenchantment, I think, in English.

                        Conservative means that there’s different lineages in Taiwan.

                        Through the cyberspace, they can find like-minded people, and doing co-creations together. That is how Wikipedia is done, right? Just by individual writers banding together in cyberspace to make an encyclopedia.

                    <p>
                        That is a very creative notion, and I think, as a creator, if I had to rely on the immediate vicinity, the like-minded people will be very few. Because of cyberspace, it is a very vast community, easily in the tens of thousands.

                        Ah, OK, because I would see it usually the other way. You are isolated, because you retreat from the community, and you somehow just play a game or whatever. Therefore, you’re not able to take part in real life.

                        No, I will say that, because of the cyberspace and the friends I met there, I very early on started couch-surfing. In 2005 and 2006, I visited maybe 12 different countries, 15 different cities, held hackathons in each.

                        I have never met the person that I stayed in their home. They just offered their sofa, their home, because we work on something together online. It’s a radical trust to random strangers. My families have a very strong heart. [laughs]

The values stay more stable and is refined over time. That’s how I treat other people, and I would like other people to treat me the same.

                        OK. You are regarded as the first transgender minister in the world. What lessons did you learn in this regard, and what advice can you give? Maybe you elaborate a bit how the Taiwanese public has reacted to your becoming the first transsexual minister, whether you experienced any insults or discriminations?

                        I don’t think people care so much about me being post-gender. It’s entirely normal. I think it speaks tons about Taiwan’s inclusiveness, tolerance, and also the vibrancy of the Taiwan pride community and the LGBTIQA+ community that our president, for example, supported marriage equality from the very beginning.
