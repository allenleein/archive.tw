                        It’s easy to describe this in the abstract fashion, like this is a sandbox, people can test self-driving vehicles. People can come and adapt them to the everyday needs of the people, but the most important thing is that all the innovations that’s featured there is open innovation. In a sense that it welcome other people to adapt and build based on it.

Either they can enter the incubator, and they can just show around their ideas like self-driving vehicles, or using machine learning to repair pipes, or to use telepresence to let people see the air quality…

People can see the flood, the public construction, the typhoon, and so on, and link what people’s ideas of what works as a water management to the government’s view, because they don’t always have the same view.

                        For the Presidential Hackathon, we use a novel voting method, where everybody have 99 points, and they can vote for any of the project, but one vote is one point. If they want to vote four vote, that is 16 point, because it’s quadratic.

                    <p>
                        If they want everything to be voted into one, that’s 9 votes costing 81 points, but everybody has 99, so you cannot vote 10 votes, and it’s by design. Because then people with 18 left, they won’t want to squander those votes, so they will find something else that they learn, they have synergy.

                    <p>
                        We will get into a place where people usually vote for four or five project after learning about their synergy. When the top 20 gets announced, everybody feel they have won.

                        If you run a popular vote with direct voting like everybody votes just to the one project, most people will feel they have lost when you announce the budget, like participatory budget or something like that. If you use quadratic voting, then everybody feel they have won. It’s a different…

                        They have to see the brief report and the idea, the sketch of the idea. The top 20 means that they get the coaching help from the President’s office, from all the different ministries, to help realizing their ideas in three months. It’s a commitment of resources. It’s a little bit like participatory budget.

                        The top five performing teams, they get the President’s Trophy, and the trophy is a projector. If you turn it on, it shows the President giving the trophy to the team. The President basically said those five team, whatever they did in the last three months, I commit myself to make it into national policy within 12 months, so it’s a presidential promise.

                        As a mayor, or as a governor, I think this is a really good what we call a binding mechanism, because if you promise too much, your staff cannot deliver, but if you promise like five teams every year, that’s about the right amount.

                        The important thing here, as with any participatory budget, is that they have to solve a real social problem. As you can see all the 20 correspond to one sustainable goal target, because we limit it to the 169 sustainable targets.

                        It’s not tilted toward technology. Technology is the 17th, and you see only one that is technology. Everything else talks about health, about agriculture, about sustainable cities, about life underwater, and talk about river, and this is the WaterBox by the way. Basically, because it’s quadratic voting, it doesn’t privilege people with a lot of followers on Facebook, because they cannot over-concentrate their vote.

                        It privileges people who build coalitions between sectors, between different political ideologies, because if you vote 7 and 7, that’s still below 99. But if you vote 9, you don’t have more than 4 to leave for the others. It rewards people who can form efficient coalitions.

                        For example, there was a team that use the same AI to go through what we call CSR, corporate sustainable report, so corporate or social responsibility – that was the old term – but nowadays they’re called sustainability report, so sustainability strategy.

                        That’s the basic idea. That may be one of the most high-profile way that people can see the incubation ideas, because we tour around Taiwan, and we also invite the winners to share their project to people around Taiwan. People around Taiwan can say we have a use case here. Maybe they’re on a remote island, and they want to have a telemedicine with the large hospitals and the doctors.

                        They can say this is a real town hall, I just go there, but the social innovation lab has 12 ministries, section chief or higher, looking at me facilitating this work. The local people just meet where they already meet. I go to them, and then I connect back to Taipei, and the people here, section chief or higher, brainstorm on the problem that people here see.

                        For example, they say the local nurse is not authorized to give medical treatment when supervised by a remote doctor. It can only by a nearby doctor, but that’s a law change. Using the Presidential Hackathon, we just escalated that into the minister level, so this year the law has changed, so the local nurse can operate based on a remote doctor.

                        We used to ask them to come to the cabinet offices set-up in the various areas, but that makes people uncomfortable. We found they are much more comfortable if they just go to where they normally have town halls, and we join them with the live streaming equipment.

                        For a town hall meeting, how can you prevent it’s being dominated by a certain group of people? Meaning some group, they have voice, NGO, sometimes they control the meeting.

                        The planning starts well before-hand. We make sure that first it’s radically transparent. Everybody in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and so on, are also participants. It’s very difficult to take over all the six different places. That’s the first thing.

                        The second thing is that we made sure that anything they propose, they have to correspond to one of the sustainable goals, so they must be talking about public benefit, not just private benefit.

                        In this kind of setting, because people generally understand no matter which faction they are on, they’re in a minority. This is a real collaborative setting. They will not be very loud, because first of all, it doesn’t matter, Taipei can just dial the volume down.
