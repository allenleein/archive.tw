                    <p>
                        You make really transcripts?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes.

                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        I thought it was just like an audio file, and that sometimes you make a transcript?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Well, it’s up to you. We can also do a video recording. But since you are producing a written report, usually we…Like if you do text, we do text. If you do video, we do video.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s the norm that we’re establishing. It’s called “radical transparency.” Let’s get started.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        The idea is that if something is published…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People have the whole context.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, yeah. They can’t say, “Hey, Minister Tang said that,” and you could still quote back to…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Always within context, yes, so people can very easily see whichever journalist, like Wall Street Journal, NPR, Deutsche Welle, Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen, and what they asked and what I answered within the context.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If you search for it, you can find this page, which is one single quote, but you can always see it within context ‑‑ how it is produced.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Is that checked a lot?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes, it is. It also enabled the journalistic community to have access to the internal meeting, because I do that not only with journalists and visitors, but for all the internal meeting that I chair as well.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It make investigative journalism easier than tabloids, because you have the raw material. You don’t have to get the scoop, so to speak, so you can work on your perspective.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        My parents were both journalists.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        I think it’s not only a lot of work but way more difficult for you, no?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        No.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Because you always have to be careful not to say anything off the record?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        No, if we, for example, go to a photo session, as we did before, because we’re not producing anything quotable, so we may chat there, but because it doesn’t result in anything binding…The idea is anything that might be binding, either in a lobbying sense or in a internal meeting sense, must be on the record.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        There is no off the record, actually.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Right. If I say something off the record, that’s in my personal time, and it must not carry any binding power.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Sometimes to protect sources or to protect partners…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes. We do have people who prefer to be anonymized in this system, and that is entirely fine. We even have…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        How do you note it, then?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We even had a journalist that requested that all their questions are removed, and only keeping my answers.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Why is that?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because they considers their questions company property. That’s fine too. It’s kind of flexible. For example, there was a visit by a think tank, and many of them prefer to speak in Chatham House rule.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When they do that, all of them are marked as “Audience Member.” Actually, this is not the exact words they say. It’s what I paraphrase. I double‑check with them. I paraphrase their words, and then that become their words with that attribution.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sometime they only agree to ask questions in a off‑the‑record setting, so I just pause the recording. [laughs] They ask the question. I continue recording, paraphrasing their question, and so on. That’s the maximum I would do.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Do you notice an effect on the…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Quality of visit? Yes.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        And on the public discussion about your work?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, definitely. There’s two main changes. The first is that people, when they lobby, under this radical transparency, they tend to make arguments that are for the global goals, that are for the public good.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even if they are arguing for a private company ‑‑ for example, Uber ‑‑ when they David Plouffe lobbied for Uber, but under this condition ‑‑ all his arguments is about climate change mitigation and so on, and so it must be a public benefit.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        He would refrain from saying anything that sounds like it’s only good for the company and me, and not the public. That’s the first thing. It’s much more prosocial and pro‑public.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The second is that I don’t have the possibility of being quoted out of context. A lot of spins in politics is about building a straw man argument, a partial quote, and then attacking that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because context travels very easily. Really, the whole context is just one search engine search away. In that context, I’ve found that almost no editor would misrepresent my words or do a straw man construction based on part of my work.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        Yeah. Of course, I hope to ask a lot of questions about disinformation. Does it also in that sense help to limit disinformation?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course, because it increase trust.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If you have someone who’s your friend who agrees to meet you every Wednesday ‑‑ as I do in a public space…There’s even no walls anymore. You can just walk straight into the Social Innovation Lab, and I’m there every Wednesday ‑‑ then if you hear some rumor or some disinformation, you will check with your friend.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If your friend only answers your email once every two months, and only on the part they choose to answer and ignore everything else, then of course you will tend to believe rumors about your friend. The basic trust, I think, is one of the key things to counter, to disarm disinformation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The other thing is humor. We do that a lot too.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Leen Vervaeke">
                    <p>
                        The other thing is humor?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, humor. Whenever there is disinformation that tries to provoke outrage, there’s a system in Taiwan ‑‑ you’ve heard about it perhaps ‑‑ that we roll out within two hours, but now usually within an hour, memes, things that go viral on the basis of humor.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For example, there was a rumor that said perming your hair would be subject to one‑million‑dollar fine. Within one hour, our prime minister wrote out this card saying, “It’s not true. I may be bald now, but I would not punish people who look like my youth.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        “What we have done is introduce a labeling requirement for hair products starting in 2021. Premier as he looks now, since if you keep perming your hair many time a week, it will not damage your pocket. It will damage your hair. When serious, you may look up. You look like me.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’ s humor, because he makes fun of himself, not other people. This goes viral, much more viral than the original disinformation. It serves as a inoculation.
                    </p>

                        According to the Taiwan Fact Check Center, there’s many different types. One is one that try to undermine the public trust in journalistic institutions. This is perhaps, I would say, one of the most serious kind because the journalism training is the main thing that disambiguates misinformation, as in misinformed, from intentional disinformation.

                    <p>
                        Anyone who have a media competency, received basic journalism training, when looking at misinformation can shield oneself from this disinformation effect and really check the sources and so on and turn the parts that’s misinformed into this kind of attribution report and turn the parts that are actually true into something that people can understand. That’s core journalism work.

                        If disinformation try to undermine trust in journalistic institutions, then that, to me, is a affront to this whole journalistic integrity system. Then it will reinforce the echo chamber effect because then it discredits the journalism in general.

                        Yeah, the Kaohsiung parade. Someone tried to frame it as Photoshopped because the lights are too close to each other, ignoring that this is what that lens is designed to do.

                    <p>
                        The Taiwan Fact Check Center has to work in a very rapid fashion to re‑establish why does this, if you have a certain lens, you will naturally look like that. It also compared to Google Street Map and so on to ensure the accuracy of this picture, even going into the forensics field.

                        This is important to restore people’s understanding that there any journalistic output went through this kind of fact checking. It’s just the institutional fact checkers won’t share their work so publicly, but a journalistic standard says that something like this must be done internally when you’re reporting anything.

                        This is the main challenge. It’s still ongoing. There’s unending ways trying to frame the journalistic output as not trustworthy, but the TFCC is working very diligently to restore this kind of journalistic integrity.

                        It’s attacking integrity of news that is actually real news. It’s at the same time spreading fake news to the point that people say that the outcome of last year’s elections might be actually influenced by it, might be different than if there would not have been so much disinformation.

There was no easy access to the Taiwan Fact Check Center.

When people see a trending frame like this, they can very easily check. Once TFCC fact‑check this, actually this number will stop increase that quickly because people won’t see this on their news feed.

                        It’s not the only example. During the Hong Kong protest, there’s many examples. During the WHA that Taiwan could not attend even as a observer to the World Health Assembly, there was a similar narrative that said that Taiwan is well‑represented because the Beijing delegate will take care, in a efficient manner, anything that the Taiwan people need to know.

                        They are a good representative to the Taiwan delegation and so on. Of course, that’s not true, but that’s their official line. That become then repackaged and shared on social media and saying that Taiwan people don’t need to worry.

                        That’s right. Still they have to undermine first people’s media competency. That is to say the capability to perform journalistic work by the people themselves, as well as relying sometimes on the institutional journalism to check the work. These narratives rely on people distrusting journalistic outputs and themselves not willing to perform journalistic work.

                        No, but sometimes the attribution by itself is good enough. If people understand this is from the state propaganda account, literally ‑‑ with all due respect, that is a state propaganda account ‑‑ then people would understand how it’s not something organic.

                        In many cases, of course, it’s not quite intentional. It’s just a rumor that mutates. You can’t quite trace the source, but then that tend to be less political in nature. Like things pertaining to health, like what fruit if microwaved would cause what disease, or whatever. It’s hard to trace the source because it’s like urban myth.

                        I would say it’s not in the best interest of government ministers to undermine trust in institutional media or in democracy itself. Information that cause public harm in terms of the long‑term trustworthiness of institutional democracy or institutional media, that’s certainly not in the best interest of the cabinet.

                        For many politicians who are more senior or they have a longer involvement in the Taiwan’s democratization, they would not like to hurt that either, whether they’re in opposition or whether they’re in the ruling party. Of course, it aligns with the PRC’s interest if people here don’t trust democracy nor the media.

                        There are also people in Taiwan who are much more, I would say, authoritarian‑leaning. They would also like people to trust less the institutional democracy and media. There are certainly both sides quite prevalent also. They sometimes reinforce each other. I wouldn’t say that one certainly cause another.

                        During their platform speeches, during their interviews, during their public conversations, these are the almost 1,000, maybe more than 1,000 now, people who type these videos into transcript, check the transcripts, separate the transcripts into individual statements, and flag the ones that they feel are wrong.

                        Especially if you want to keep liberal democracy. There’s plenty of jurisdictions nearby, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, that took this as a excuse to have the ministers words somehow even more powerful than a journalist’s words to infringe on journalistic freedom and on the civic space in general.

                        Well I was a reverse mentor to Jaclyn Tsai, a member of the Ma Ying‑jeou cabinet. Now, of course, I was promoted from intern to a full minister, I guess. [laughs] It doesn’t really matter to me because the work I do is mostly for between elections, like everyday participatory democracy through petitions, participatory budget, all sorts of electronic participation, presidential hackathon.

                        All these are things that are done between elections. I work mostly on the participative part of democracy. That part can be contributed across sectors. I’m ostensibly working with the public sector, but I’m not working for the public sector. I’m still a bridge between the public sector and the social and economic sectors.
