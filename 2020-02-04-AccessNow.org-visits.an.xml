                        Yes, exactly. They are friends. As an organization, we are very young. We’re around now 11 years old. I joined the organization five years ago. I’m a lawyer by training but I work in the tech sector. I worked in Google previously. What Access Now does is very international.

                        It’s a society organization that tries to protect and extend the digital rights of users at risk. We now more broadly see our mandate to protect human rights in the digital age with a focus on things like privacy, data protection, online freedom of expression, pushing back against excessive content regulation, network neutrality, and openness and open cultures that make the Internet possible.

                        We are now a 75-member organization across the world and over 75 people on the team, roughly, split into teams that work on digital security, which is the core of access. That’s how we know so many people in Taiwan as well.

We have a digital security helpline that works 24/7 to provide them free help.

                        Ellie and many others of our team have often come to Taiwan. There’s a large community as you know who works with these issues. Very, very happy to work with them. In addition to that, we have teams that work on policy and advocacy. I work with the policy team. I’m a director of policy covering the Asia-Pacific region as well as global cybersecurity.

                        We have staff mostly based out of South Asia and Melbourne and we work on policy issues here. Then we also have teams that work on grants. We support small NGOs and activists across the region. We have money, that SIDA, Swedish International Development Agency, provided that allows us to give money to other organizations in the global setting.

                    <p>
                        It ranges. We do quick, strategic, I’d say, rapid-response rounds of $500 to $5,000.

                        We’re trying to grow that further as well. We also with other NGOs, also provide emergency funds. For example, if an activist is under physical threat or attack in the digital space in their country, along with many other NGOs, we’ve got a small fund where they allow them to be able to fly out immediately, get free assistance.

                        We support that sort of thing as well and do much more. The more nimble quick micro-grants and stuff in the tech space. Imagine if a NGO has been attacked or targeted, they need quickly to buy new cell phones, or new server space online, or they need to buy encrypted devices, we can quickly help and assist with that. That’s the sort of things we do.

                        We’ve been very, in fact, again helped in that by not just working with Taiwanese groups but the insights they’ve had. The bigger thing that many people know us for is RightsCon. Nikki is the head of RightsCon. She is the director, so I’ll let her introduce this.

                    <p>
                        Sure. RightsCon started in 2011 as the Silicon Valley Human Rights Conference. We’ve been running it ever since then. It’s grown quite a bit since then. At its core, it is about convening multi-stakeholder groups to talk about human rights in the digital age. We’ve seen over the last few years quite a transition from traditional digital rights conversations to human rights in the digital age.

                    <p>
                        In Brussels, we grew quite a bit. We had around just over 1,200 participants in 2017 that came. That was when we marked a transition of more and more human rights groups, humanitarian actors. Others that hadn’t traditionally seen themselves in the digital rights space were coming because technology was continuously impacting their work.

                    <p>
                        Since then we’ve seen a lot of growth in terms of RightsCon. We had our most recent event in Tunisia. We had nearly 3,000 registered participants and 400 sessions that happened across the four days of the summit.

                        That brought participants from 130 countries but also all of the major private companies, a lot of governments, and academia, press. It’s very much a civil society-owned summit. We run the summit, but 50 percent of the participants are civil society.

                        It’s a good problem to have. There’s growing scope in terms of the conversations that we can have. We really focus on outcomes, so we think that connecting people is really important. We also really think that, moving forward, the shared agenda is our utmost priority.

                        As we’ve grown, we just haven’t really increased any of the plenary-style sessions, which makes it a very much different dynamic. Our focus is really about decentralizing some of the conversations that happen, making sure that people who don’t normally get to go to these global forums have a voice and that their voices are equally heard in the conversations that they need to be.

                        This year’s will be in Costa Rica. We recognized we haven’t brought it back to Asia since 2015 when it was in The Philippines and it was much smaller then. Now that it’s reached the size it has, it seems very important to bring it back to Asia. We have, as you were both saying, active Taiwanese community that comes, and also not as many from the region as we would like given the size and scope of the issues that are represented here.

                        It’s a really good. It’s just that for South Asian destinations, Taiwan is slightly closer to the other South Asian countries, but if you have a truly global audience, the air travel to Seoul and to Taipei is probably the same.

I would say the mayor of Seoul is doing more or less the same thing. On the transparency side, we’re very similar. His mayor hall is totally transparent, while my office, which is not this building, by the way. They arranged this building to have official meeting. This is my office.

                        In any case, the culture is similar. What I’ve heard from, as I said, the Open Tech Fund and Oslo Freedom Forum organizers is that they found that because Taiwan has absolute freedom of expression, we’re the only jurisdiction according to CIVICUS Monitor that a journalist’s word is exactly worth the same as the minister’s word.

                    <p>
                        There is no censorship that a minister can force a journalist to do anything. Even Japan or South Korea have certain legal mechanisms for that sort of thing, but Taiwan is the only one in Asia, and along with New Zealand, the only two in Asia-Pacific, that is completely free.

                        That ensures that even if the speakers, they might say something that is very contradictory to what we in the government believe, they will face no consequence. That is their main impression, and we are committed to keep that, this absolutely open score CIVICUS Monitor. That is one advantage, I would say.

                        I think it’s not just for my learning experience. I think it’s also if other people would like the government of Taiwan to make certain commitments there, for example around the announcement of our National Action Plan for Open Government, which the first draft for comment will be published by then, which is being co-created with the civil society.

                        Unlike other national action plans which are two years long and often spans different administrations, ours takes effect on May, which is the inauguration day of Dr. Tsai Ing-wen’s second term and runs for four years, exactly ending on the term.

In their words, we’re worth the same as theirs. I think that would be a contribution, if it makes sense to you, to that RightsCon.

                        The Foreign Service handles that, I’m sure. I will also say that each municipality have a different focus. For example, I think Taoyuan City is very much focused on human right. They run participatory budget with participants of all the migrant workers, like not residents.

                        They don’t have voting power, but they can do a participatory budgeting process about how the migrant workers and, indeed, any immigration policy budget is allocated, like “nothing about them without them.” I think this is truly creative, and it is outside traditional participatory democracy landscape because they probably won’t ever have the right to vote.

If you want to talk about environmental protection and so on, Kaohsiung really is the place. What I’m trying to say is that if you talk only within the Taipei City ecosystem, you’re just, frankly speaking, one of the many international NGOs.

                        There’s a limited space for Taipei for the large events like this, but Taoyuan, for example, is extremely convenient now that the Metro is working. It’s just half an hour or something. Taoyuan, Taichung, or Kaohsiung, anything that the high-speed rails reaches, I would say that their municipality would then have extra bonus programs.

                        We are trying to have people in governments speak up to this, really pushback on that. Beyond that, the issue is more extensively on privacy and data protection, not just on surveillance but making sure there are good data protection laws in countries to hold corporate entities on data to account. Make sure the data apocalypse that’s happening is reigned back a bit in.

                        The other issue for us is definitely cybersecurity, at both the national and global level in Asia-Pacific. Both in terms of increasing government commitments to global cyber norms, actually creating them. They’re seeing this message that, “Oh, we will run this operation because you ran this operation against us.”

                        But try and at least say, “Look, cyberspace is a global commons. We need rules that protect everyone on this.” But also ensuring that these  re not just military or intelligence-dominated. Citizens, developers, tech organizers, they’re able to have to a voice in that. Right now, it’s very either big company, or big military, or some type government-based in terms of conversations.

                        These are some of the priorities for us in the region. The other thing, very honestly, we’re also trying to do is drive more connection on digital rights of the Asia-Pacific tech community, and by that, I mean particularly tech companies, hardware manufacturers.

                        Some of them are starting to engage on the issues such as free speech, privacy, but that’s rarer. It’s normally enclaves of these developments. Sometimes in India, sometimes in Hong Kong, sometimes very rarely in Singapore. In Taiwan, particularly at least on open government, very active conversation.

                        We’re trying drive more engagement on that, because most tech development right now frankly is happening in Asia-Pacific. The majority of the world this is China, India, Taiwan, Australia, Indonesia. Most of the more modern, interesting tech developments are also happening here, in terms of app creation, coding more generally, even the tech sector, but there’s not enough engagement of the digitalized community on that, in our view.

                        For example, I think it’s long enough that I won’t offend anyone by saying this. Long ago, there was no concept of unions. It is in the capitalist’s best interest to keep the workers ignorant of the idea of worker’s assembly, strike, or cooperatives.

                        The more the workers are ignorant about these ideas of rights, the more that they can extract a better bargaining position vis-à-vis individual workers. Because of this, I would say this current state of ignorance, whether in a ignorance of what we call negative liberties, like freedom from surveillance, in the Isaiah Berlin sense.

                        It is not because of lack of education. We teach that in our civics class. We have really good teachers. It’s because either surveillance status or surveillance capitalists try to create a counter norm, where even the word user…

                        Instead of user experience, addictive design, and all those bad words, in my experience, just to think about human experience, itself, liberates people from a kind of user point of view, vis-à-vis the data collectors, be it public or private sector.

                        Just to verify that there is such a norm is what my main work in Taiwan is about, which is why our conversation’s going to be radically transparent, structured conversation in Akoma Ntoso format. Then people understand that whatever their right is being concerned, even in a drafting stage, even when it’s still being considered, there’s plenty of opportunity for them to make a informed voice about that.

                        Which is why all the legislative agenda around kind of censorship always gets a published pushback, but not at the parliamentary floor, like right in the drafting table. They never come to fruition, and so they don’t need amendments, such as for certain encryption things.

                        In any case, [laughs] that is my main point is that the earlier that we can share the policymaking context, the more people understand there’s certain norms in the world. We don’t have to do it purely from an individual’s viewpoint, which, by the way, isn’t the traditional paradigm here in East Asia. [laughs]

                        But rather in what I usually call data coalition or data co-operative, or data union. There’s many different words to say the same thing, which is essentially people who produce data band together and demand governance support and establish their own norm to negotiate with the public sector, which then co-negotiate.

For them in a non-human-right-infringing way to basically say at the same sender if they still send unsolicited email, then it goes to the junk mail box instead of inbox. Which is certainly not exactly like less of free expression, but it makes the free-righters less economically incentive.
