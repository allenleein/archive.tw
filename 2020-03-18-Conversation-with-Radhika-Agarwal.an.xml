                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        How are you doing in Singapore?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Good. It’s been nice to be back here. I’m sure you’ve seen the news about New York these days. It’s pretty crazy times there. I lived in Singapore when SARS was a thing here 18 years ago.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Being back in Singapore, you can see that it’s a country that obviously will also have struggles with the virus, but here it feels like things are more being controlled as changes happen, as opposed to in the US, where currently it feels like no one really knows how to get things under control and when that will happen.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We heard the local clinics are really empowered to be a trusted place instead of a few large hospitals. That’s really commendable.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, definitely. How are things going in Taiwan? I remember the last time we spoke you said that things were partially under control or at least it felt…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There’s no exponential growth. There’s no overt panic. People get masks quite easily. Just finished the first round of mask online ordering system which delivers to convenience stores. It’s going pretty well. We’re still in the double digits per day, mostly case from abroad.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        That sounds great. Given the rise in cases in the UK and the US, I definitely think in the last few days in Singapore it’s risen a little bit. Then of course, hopefully these things settle down. It’s nice to know that here people are still going outside and you can still go for a run in these kinds of things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was actually in Copenhagen as well a few days ago now, I guess. I left right before they shut the border. For a few days, I felt like I was running to different parts of the world figuring out where I would end up being based.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Maybe since you mentioned we have about 40 minutes, I was curious how the work that you’ve been doing has shifted based on the coronavirus. I read online that there were some different platforms you were working on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Here, the you is definitely plural. I personally work only 24 hours a day. [laughs] There’s a limited amount of hours in a day. Truth to be told the civic tech community has really rose up to the challenge. Just on the pharmacy, mask rationing alone, there’s more than 100 different applications.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There’s voice assistance, there’s chatbox, there’s all sort of different things that quells the fear, uncertainty, and doubt, not only around mass distribution. Of course, as the professional pharmacists are distributing those masks, they also deliver a much-needed education about hand sanitation. All the masks are useless without a good hand sanitation habit and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think the pedagogy of the teaching the good habits to work around the various inherent limitations of human beings, such as the inability to spot people’s reflex to touch their mouth or the social distancing, it’s all very counterintuitive. It really needs just constant education and interaction opportunities with robots, and with the online knowledge materials, with visualizations, and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Just last Saturday, the g0v community had a more than 100 people large gathering, but purely online. People were in satellite places, had a hackathon together. We order pizza separately but ate in the same time. [laughs] The social distancing doesn’t get too much in the way of the community spirit.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People from Japan, Code for Japan. people from Korea, all joined us on a hackathon. It’s such a success that we’re looking to repeat the experience more in the future.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        I see. Was that just a bunch of people on like Zoom platformers or Skype, where it was a bunch of individuals on stream?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s accurate actually. We have a very, very low latency YouTube streaming, domain architect, which goes by the name of Roni, was one of the very early g0v core project owners. He basically devised this way, where people can just randomly type questions and so on Slack, and it will just float past this live-streamed video.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There’s a tour where people…so people pre-record the three keyword to introduce themselves. For example, my three keywords were Taiwan Can Help, or Health4All, and these things.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The other thing that goes around here is after the three keywords is heard and all the project pitch is done, each project is assigned a HackMD, which is like Google Doc, which associates with a Jutsu, which is like a Zoom channel. Just like open space technology, you can walk from a corner to a corner.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Each of these online places is a corner. There are people who tour, newcomers, on the main YouTube channel to switch between those dozen or so different project corners, to get people a sneak peek into what people are talking about or working on so that if you feel interested, you can then drop by that channel and join that corner. It’s quite sophisticated.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        It’s interesting. I think that that event that you’re mentioning, is actually in the realm of social technology and bringing people together. I think what’s quite interesting about pandemics are these types of situations. I think it’s very revelatory, in terms of what systems are broken or what things are not operating the way you think they are.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        I think one of the interesting ironies that we’re seeing now is with Instagram and these types of platforms, that are supposed to be social platforms. I think many are saying about how isolating it is, even in this time of social distancing. It becomes quite apparent of how things are working. That’s really interesting.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        I know that when we met last time, you had mentioned briefly some of the initiatives that your team is going to be focusing on in the coming years. One of the ones you mentioned was not overhaul the websites, but thinking about how the websites become more accessible to migrants.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        I was just wondering…we didn’t talk too much at dinner. What are some of the other things that you’re excited to be working on or are top of mind for you in the coming months?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        As I mentioned, I think I mentioned the RAY Project, which is Rescue Action by Youth Project, which is about young user experience designers, usually in graduate school, but we hire undergrad too, as a two months intern to look systematically at some of the highest-profile websites and services, and do this design overhaul of it. That’s what we mentioned.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There’s also, of course, the Presidential Hackathon, which is about a disclosed sectoral collaboration. We’re now brainstorming about a fast track version of the Presidential Hackathon. We don’t have an English name for it actually. We currently call it the 防疫松. Literally, the counter epidemic hackathon, which doesn’t have a ring to it.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        It’s still pretty good.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Right. Maybe we call it Coronathon or something.

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Yeah. That’s true. I can just see the branding now. [laughs]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Suggestions are welcome. It’s like a fast-tracked Presidential Hackathon, where we have two or three weeks of a Polis, which I showed you or at least described last time. It’s about getting the rough consensus of what’s the more pertinent issues to be addressed.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The idea is that we interview maybe five or seven top experts currently working on the CECC, the Center for Epidemic Control, asking if you don’t have any technology or budget constraints, then what is the single tool or the single idea that you think if implemented well, in a rapid fashion, would significantly reduce the RO, or something like that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We get those five or seven ideas online, we ask people to upload or download them, and if you are a frontline medical worker and you have a better idea to be implemented, then you can just contribute. After two weeks or three, we will have a rough consensus on what is the most legit innovations that is interesting during this coronavirus session.

                    <p>
                        Chances are that A, it will be useful internationally as well. B, it will test the constitutional limit around privacy. [laughs]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        Yes.

                    <p>
                        We were thinking about also having a regulatory impact assessment team in an ongoing fashion. For example, people will probably say, “I want a tool that can just download all my Google Maps data, or my Facebook data, or my Instagram data, and tell me how likely I am within close encounter of somebody who has been known as having been infected so that I can better prepare myself.”
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s a very simple idea. It could be implemented in three ways. One is that the government can have all the data, and then you just go to a government website. You key in your easy card number or whatever, and then it gives you the thing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That means the government is the top aggregator of all the conceptual data, which creates privacy nightmares by the Taiwan standards. Maybe by Singapore standards, it’s fine. [laughs]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Radhika Agarwal">
                    <p>
                        It’s different.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Or of course, each individual vendors can agree on a data exchange format, so that you send requests separably to dozens of us, and that only gets you back a hash or something, and then you compute the hash yourself offline. That’s the second model. Or people can voluntarily join a mutual or collaborative, and people joining that data union or something like that.

                    <p>
                        We talked a little bit about that before. We’ll willingly share their private movement information, but only with people in the same cooperative, or in the same family, and so on. That’s a social sector perspective. Of course, the first one is more constitutionally troubling. The second one is slightly better. The third one, of course, can even be run in normal times.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The regulatory assessment team’s idea is just for each idea to triage the possible solution landscape into red, yellow, and green lights respectively. After two or three weeks of gathering of the more pertinent questions to be asked, then we just label three or five of them saying, “OK. Now we’re asking for solutions.”
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People have two weeks or three weeks to start jamming on the solutions. Again, they have to be open-source, because, for all non-green light solutions, they are going to be run on real private data. If they’re not open source, all sorts of troubles will occur. We’re thinking about launching this in a few week. That’s another new topic that haven’t risen up when we talked in New York.

                    <p>
                        That sounds fascinating, as I was wondering what new opportunities for innovation come out of this type of challenging situation. I know we had spoken when we were both in New York, about how I have a particular interest, I guess, from a long time, in these types of topics, if that’s not weird to say I guess, because the topic is a pandemic.

                        I remember we didn’t talk too much about it when we met last. As mentioned, Audrey, it would be great to find a way to collaborate. I guess, part of why I wanted to have this call, which is to chat about some of the things that you have going on, understand also a bit more about…I know it is a part of the Taiwanese government, so I’m not sure how much collaboration is done with international.

                        It sounds like you guys are very open to that. I was hoping just to chat about what you guys have going on, and then if you see ways that we could maybe work together, and maybe brainstorm what that could look like.

                        Our office is pretty well connected because the initial founders came already, I think I mentioned that before, abroad from the design community. We currently have two colleagues in UK, and also quite a few international visiting researchers as well over the years.

                    <p>
                        With Singapore actually, Singapore GovTech, we connected very early on, both on law and consultation. Actually, they also develop a mass rationing system online. We learned copiously from their design and experience. We didn’t reuse any code, but it was a early inspiration. I think on the GovTech front, we’re very well connected.

                        Now, wearing my other hat, the civic tech front, I think the g0v community is already very international. They have a dedicated English channel and even Japanese channel, with automated translations and things like that. If you joined g0v Slack, that’s join.g0v.tw, then you’ll find plenty of people who don’t speak Mandarin.

                        There is not so much a design thing, unless you consider participatory mechanism design as design, which I guess is design. It’s the RadicalxChange community which does the Singapore chapter. It is mostly about a set of labs that use mechanism design, the idea to, for example, rethink how taxation works, rethink how spectrum allocation works, and so on.

                        It’s more wider swathe, broader swathe design, but because there’s a strong link between the RadicalxChange community and the Ethereum community, most of the too-crazy-to-be-realized designs ends up realized in Ethereum anyway as GetCoins and so on. That’s another community that I am personally interested in, but it’s less related to my day job.

We collaborated – and by we I mean my day job, PDIS – I think three, four of us, collaborated on the CrowdLaw Playbook. The first banner is called CrowdLaw for Congress, which just launched. We collaborated on the playbook part of it. The other part is the data collaborative, which, of course, Presidential Hackathon in Taiwan is a Data Collaborative.

                        That’s right. If you are based in Singapore, then there’s a lot of synchronous. If I knew that you were in Singapore in a stay-at-home hackathon, I might have invited you to join, because it’s an all-day-long event. Asking someone in New York to do that would just be cruel. [laughs]

                    <p>
                        In Singapore, it’s just like asking you to commit a whole Saturday, it sounds reasonable.

                        Just some community events, especially the upcoming Coronathon if it’s a thing. I’ll properly invite you to give some ideas as well as see if you can see if some people in Singapore have some ideas. Truth be told, a lot of the data that we’re going to open up as synthetic data sets are going to be in Mandarin.

                    <p>
                        People in Singapore who at least have a friend who can read a little bit of Mandarin is at an advantage when attempting to tackle those issues or come up with better ideas. That’s a natural opportunity for you to meet people who share your enthusiasm in this topic. [laughs] Something like this together.

                        Also, fighting coronavirus, there’s instant gratification, because you can just see flattening the curve happening on a day-to-day basis if you do something right, but for climate change, you have to wait quite a while for whatever you’re doing to have an effect on climate change. There is a shorter attention span topic to work on.

It’s very early. Chances also are the cabinet meeting tomorrow will say it’s a great idea, but maybe not the most pressing thing to do. That’s also possible.

                        Sounds good. In terms of the teams for the Coronathon or the hackathon, is it individual participants are welcome, or is it mostly based by team? If by team, are there core skillsets that are…?

                        Instead, we do whatever it takes to make your idea real, I would say. It will require a team, obviously. That’s when we expect international participants to come in pre-formed teams.

There’s bound to be people who propose a good idea, but these ideas are not selected into the final ideas set. They become free radicals to join the solution teams for those ideas.
