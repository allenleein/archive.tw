                    <p>
                        Let’s get started.

                    <p>
                        Great. Thank you. I thought we would start with I had some questions about particular things that you guys were doing during the early pandemic response, and then we can move on to more abstract questions I have for you about the Taiwan model.

                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        You talked about transparency a lot as one of the key pillars in your work here. One of the ways in which that value really expressed itself was via open data when it came to the real-time mask supplies.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        I was wondering, just starting from when you guys tapped in to the effort, if you could walk me through the various initiatives in which there was a move of some kind to open up more data, government data to civic hackers to the public community, if we could just go through that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sure. One of the most important ideas is about this OpenAPI, which is making available, for example, the amount of mask in each pharmacy every 30 seconds. We call it OpenAPI because it’s refreshing almost real-time. If we had published it once a day, that’s just open data. There’s a real difference, even though that it is, of course, still open data that we’re pushing out.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        According to most of the other counties for the Information Acts, usually, those data will pass a human review, which necessitates a longer publishing schedule, like once per week or, at most, once per day. This person has to review it every day before it tallies at the end of the day.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        By publishing every 30 seconds, we’re essentially saying that this is machine to machine. It doesn’t go through a human review. It says that we can’t even hide any glitches from the general public.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If people queue in line in a pharmacy and swipe their NHI card nowadays, they will expect that people came after them can refresh their map and see the number decreased by 9 if you’re adult, or 10 if you are a child. Had we published it every day, it’s not possible.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        Wait, but you said there’s still a 30-minute window?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        30 seconds. At most, the longest window is three minutes. We don’t do longer than three minutes intervals. That’s because each transaction is, on average, two to three minutes. It means that people coming in can keep each other honest, keep the system accountable, and making sure the pharmacy isn’t stowing away the masks or something.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        The Open API was available for the supply of masks at all the different pharmacies.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        Were there any other data sets?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s the decision that we made. It was February 6, the first day of the pharmacy-based mask rationing. In the morning, the open data was like open data. It’s published. The National Health Insurance Administration originally planned to publish a few times a day, after human review, of course.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Very quickly, people found out that if the map has only stale information, it actually creates more confusion than it solves confusion, because then really what it would use is yesterday’s numbers for people queuing, not today. We keep pushing the NHIA to reduce the interval.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        They’re like, “Yeah, but that means that outside developers will have incorrect information and we have to correct it afterwards, because there’s no human review.” Then there’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in. That’s how we welcome the input. By afternoon that day, it’s switched to every 30 seconds.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        Same day?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It is the same day.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        By the end of the first day, it was already OpenAPI.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right. There’s many discrepancies, of course. There’s pharmacies tending on number plates and just collecting NHI cards. They swipe the NHI card at their leisure and ask people to come with number plates in the afternoon. The map will show a gradual decrease, but actually it’s like this in the field. That created a lot of confusion.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We listened to the pharmacists because in one of the early mask availability projects from Jiang Mingzong, the one with a lot of triangles are the most popular one now. Each pharmacist can type in public notes for other customer to see. There’s many pharmacists that just say numbers are wrong because they handed out numbered tokens.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We had to adjust the data schema, meaning the structure of the data, adding, for example, availability times, hours. We even developed a feature where a pharmacy, after handing out all the numbered tokens, they can press a key and disappear in the map, and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This is a real co-creation. That’s how the light gets in. It makes all the misassumptions, wrong assumptions very transparent to people as well. People did complain about it, and every time they complain about it, we fix it every other Thursday. In the beginning, every Thursday.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A few clarifying questions on what you just said.

                    <p>
                        Sure.

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        First of all, sorry, what are number tokens? How does that system…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Right. It’s called 號碼牌. Basically, they will, for example, for 200 masks per day, they will have small cards with handwritten numbers or printed numbers from 1 to 100.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For people queuing in line, sometimes, some pharmacies, they do handing the pharmacies their NHI card in exchange for the plate. Then they can go to work, have lunch, or something.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        Oh, I see.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        They very quickly absorb all the queuing people.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        It’s like a reservation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Right, and once the 200th token is handed out, they say, “We’re out of masks.” At a backstage, they are slowly swiping the NHI card. It creates a discrepancy.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Xin Huang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, I see, thanks. Then when you’re describing a lot of that, you said, “Starting with the first day of the mask rationing policy, we kept pushing the NHIA.” When you say we, do you mean the digital ministry, you guys here in the government?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Well, just me, [laughs] but of course, there’s people working also as secondments from other ministries as well. The people you see are also part of PDIS. By we, I mostly mean our office.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think there were, the people pushing for the quicker intervals are Zach Huang, my executive secretary and Bing-Luen Zhuang, used to be our intern, but now a full-time, software engineer. Also, Targee Hsu, so the four of us.

                    <p>
                        Beyond the real-time mask supplies, were there any other more qualitatively different datasets that you guys put on OpenAPI or that you guys pushed the boundaries of transparency by opening up to this open data philosophy?

                    <p>
                        Sure. Another thing of value, I think, is the…Let me get the English name right. Just a second.

                    <p>
                        I think the dashboard, even though it’s standard now, is a interesting story of compromise. For a long time, this has been around for other respiratory disease. This has come from cases by counties and cities.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        People kept pushing for finer resolution, like to district level or to even smaller levels, like township. The CECC keeps saying no. I think this is a non-radical transparency issues. Like for each confirmed cases, there’s a number.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Each confirmed cases has this case history that says how many people are checked and/or quarantined because of this particular case, so there’s a history. You always only see up to the county or city level.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It never reveals any spatial resolution that is finer than county or city level. This is, I think, a good decision, a publishing only in the aggregate, so that reidentification is very difficult. Not entirely impossible, but I think for the vast majority of cases, the journalists worked with the CECC to not publish reidentifiable information.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        So that once they recovered, there’s no, or little to no, labeling effect for those people. The crucial thing here is that, if we publish, as many people demanded CECC, any more detail, reidentification would be inevitable.

                        Then people who show any symptoms will fear the social pressure. Then they will not wear mask, show up to a local clinic, and get checked. Then that will probably cause a community transmission.

                        Since the very beginning, there’s this tug-of-war going on. I think, just by saying very clearly that we do not publish any cases, travel history, if we already know through contact tracing interviews, exactly who that person have reached…

                        The medical officer’s team has that information, because they are the interviewers. The person who make the final decision whether to publish or not is Commander Chen Shih-chung. That’s pretty much it.

                        For example, there was a case where the contact tracing interview for someone working as a professional waitress in an intimate drinking bar pretended to be not a professional of that kind on the first day of the contact tracing interview.

                        Then said a very different story on the second day of contact tracing interview. Then we had a very long discussion.

                        The ultimate result was that there was no persecution. We do not introduce, not even fines, let alone criminal charges, if they cannot keep contact tracing, contact book for all their customers, because we understand many of customers do not want to be reidentified.

                        Also, they couldn’t keep the physical distance very well. That’s the point. We didn’t say that it’s illegal. We’re saying essentially, Minister is saying, before they can do those things – keeping a contact history and keep the physical distance – then he would encourage people to not visit these places.

                        He would encourage these business owners to shut down their business until they figure it out. That’s softest possible way to go about this. Actually, that’s the only legal way, because we have no state of emergency. [laughs]

                        I think Minister Chen operates on what I call the Pygmalion effect. He expects the nightclub and intimate drinking bar owners to figure out something. Then, after a couple months, they did. They figured out that they can ask for a pseudonym.

                        Yeah, it’s still growing. If you ask when is the most intense, that’s a different question. I think when Howard Wu wrote the first crowdsourcing mask availability map, I think he started having that idea around end of January and started coding at the very beginning of February, and then offer it to the public.

                        The channel would eventually split off the general channel and then move onto the mask channel, which gets renamed to the COVID-19 channel. I think at any time, there is more than 500 members on that channel, which is a very sizable developer base.

Altogether, I think we reach more than half the population in the first week, which is I think the first time that civic tech became essentially public infrastructure.

                        To your mind, what are the links between the Sunflower movement and the public response to the Sunflower occupation and 2020 government trust, social trust, and how all of that came together in this pandemic response?

                        I think the ideas of accountability really changed. In Sunflower, the idea is that accountability could be participatory. It could be direct. You can just show up in the parliament or watch the live stream, ask your question, and expect it to be answered.

                        They also really want to communicate directly to the people, instead of through caricatures, through various different channels.

                        It’s mutual as well. The public sector can ask the social sector to work on things that the social sector considers important, but it’s inappropriate for the public sector to work on these things. For example, fact-checking.

If we say that we’re fact-checkers, that will actually throw all the journalism standards. We’re just saying, “No, we provide timely responses to journalistics inquiries, but it’s people in the social sector that are fact-checkers.
