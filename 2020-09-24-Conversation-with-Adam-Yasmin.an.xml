                    <p>
                        Great. Thank you so much, and good morning. I’m here with Audrey Tang calling in from Taiwan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pretty good. I just woke up, returned from the Taoyuan City back to the Taipei City. Now, I’m back in the Cabinet Office.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        Wow. I’m just going to jump into it and just ponder out loud that I imagine that politically speaking, we may look like as much of a circus as we probably project out to the world, but I just want to know how your week. [laughs] How’s your week been unfolding so far? [laughs]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My week so far, like the past four days?

                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        Mm-hmm.

                    <p>
                        It’s been an interesting experience. Just yesterday, around 24 hours ago, I was in the Confronting Disinformation, a Harvard Kennedy School conversation, and it was really interesting to look back at our counter-disinformation strategy.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s called humor over rumor, with a cute spokesdog and things like that, and just reflect how this…No takedown, no lockdown premise, because in Taiwan, we remember the martial law, so we wouldn’t do administrative takedown. We remember how bad SARS 1.0 and the lockdown was, so we wouldn’t do a lockdown, and how that has really informed our strategy of cross-sectoral collaboration.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        How this society at large, the worldwide society, now, most of the countries have some experience with lockdowns, how that may motivate them into working into a more resilient way of working with the virus, both of the mind and of the body.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        From this perspective here in the States, everything I read about the response having come from Taiwan, as well as your background, and having listened to interviews you’ve given in the last six, seven, eight months regarding this topic.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        The people that I have shared the story of Taiwan with as it pertains to not just, as you mentioned, the pandemic, but the infodemic, from here, looks like science fiction.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        Everyone that I had shared the story with and shared relevant current information regarding it, there is a moment in which people are temporarily able to almost see clearly, if you will, what is possible and what is happening elsewhere in this world that we share.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        Yet, I don’t know how to respond to people when they share that it is seemingly science fiction, given not just the citizens perspective on the pandemic but also the government’s response. I wonder if you could speak a little bit to how that transparent governance, that two-way system is doing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When I was a child, I read mostly evidence-based science fiction, literally, the short-story evidence from Asimov. Not all science fiction are fantasies, like the amazing stories. [laughs] There are also stories based on scientific rigor.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Social science is a kind of science too. One of the most rigorous findings of the social sciences, at least, around our corner of the world is that the more the government trusts its citizens, the more citizens become worthy of trust. It’s called the Pygmalion effect. It’s been studied by social scientists.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because very early on, we understood that if we get three quarters of people wearing masks and washing your hands regularly, then the R0 value will be under one. That’s, again science. It’s a modeling by our top epidemiologist who literally wrote a textbook, also actually our Vice President at a time.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        At a time, we all learned from [inaudible 4:50] that there is just this three-quarters goal to be met. The thing is that we can ramp up mass production. We can even deliver it to people’s homes, but it doesn’t ensure necessarily proper use. It doesn’t ensure necessarily that people, combined with hand sanitation and later on physical distancing, as to how to make it work.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think the Pygmalion effect is the strongest when the people think that when the CECC – that’s the Central Epidemic Command Center – tells us to wear masks where we wear a mask.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even when CECC for 48 hours said that, in well-ventilated places on the metro when the metro is running, and if you are healthy, you don’t need to wear a mask, well, people wear masks, anyway. The idea is that there’s a strong social sector demand for the economic sector to work with the government to deliver as much masks as there are in the citizenry each day.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        People are not satisfied until they can get to that number, so becoming popular demand, so comes along the social innovation. For example, using traditional rice cookers, one can disinfect the mask, kill the virus, but not destroy the PPE material, and reuse the medical mask.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even though it’s designed as one-time use, but you can reuse it three to five times. Now, that’s social innovation, because rice cookers wasn’t invented for that purpose. Neither is medical mask, by the way, but our Food and Drug Administration repeated the experiment as scientifically required and found that it’s exactly the case.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We invited Professor Lai Chane-yu, the social innovator, to explain the science in our daily CECC press conference while the Minister of Health and Welfare, Chen Shih-chung, literally cooked a mask in front of the nation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s social innovation. That’s promoting social innovators and amplifying their new ideas so that we can hit that three-quarters goal, and people would actually understand that it’s their idea, their innovation that makes it happen sooner, not a top-down government approach.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        I wonder if, given the predominant culture of “I, me, mine” here in the United States, how can anyone – not even just as a citizen here, but how can anyone – begin to speak to the larger society here to explain the difference between protecting yourself, and in doing so, you’re able to protect other people by wearing masks?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Adam Yasmin">
                    <p>
                        It seems as though the notion of masks as some kind of a personal infringement or censorship issue, it’s as crazy as wildfire here, quite literally.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think one of the things that we get right from the beginning was taking an entirely rational self-interest message when it comes to mask use. The spokesdog literally said that you wear masks to protect yourself from your own unwashed hands.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There’s nothing altruistic in this use, and it combines mask use and hand sanitation. I bet that this message will also have a higher R-value than, “You wear a mask to show respect,” or, “You wear a mask to protect other people,” in your country as well.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think appealing to self-interest is bound to have a higher R-value. I don’t think there is much of a cultural difference here.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Right, interesting. That’s good to point out. I appreciate that. I have so many questions all simultaneous at the same time. Are you drinking tea or coffee right now?

                        That’s a community called Global Tea Hut, and I find it not only just something that, tea as an immersive experience is something that also touches on notions of hygiene, sanitation, cleansing not just physically speaking, but also spiritually speaking.

                        We first started this whole open source, open publication blogging movement in Taipei. We meet weekly – that was in the early 2000s – in the Wistaria Tea House. Wistaria Tea House is one of the main places. It’s a historical building where many of Taiwan’s democratic struggles and movements were born out of.

                        I think it’s right that around the turn of the century the Internet-based blogging culture, that’s also one of the major part of it. The current steward of the Wistaria Tea House, Chow Yu, at the time was proposing that the four words, [Mandarin] , to be rigors, to be calm, to be clear, and to be circular and [Mandarin]. We all learned quite a bit from that in our blogging circle. Also very circular.

                        Beautiful. I’ve heard of Wistaria, and I look forward one day to visiting. I also read that you touch on Taoism as a resource for how you develop your philosophies and how you operate as a digital minister. I wonder if you could touch on that as well.

                        Usually, I use the Ursula Le Guin translation because I think it’s more poetic. It’s the idea, the wholeness. I translated that a moment ago, the [Mandarin] , as rigor, but you can also translate it as wholeness or integrity for lack of a better term.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The idea is, to quote Tao Te Ching, the 39th chapter, “Heaven through its wholeness is pure, Earth through its wholeness is steady, spirit through its wholeness is potent. The valley through its wholeness flows with rivers, and the 10,000 things, through their wholeness, live.” Rulers, through their wholeness have authority. Their wholeness makes them what they are.

                    <p>
                        A very interesting thing is, to me, the quotation, the line in it that says, “The valley, through its wholeness flows with rivers.” Not for the rivers, not by the rivers, [laughs] not of the rivers, but with the rivers. This is the very Taoist notion of making a space, not a object. The space contains objects, but does not belong to any particular object.

                        The potentials can realize themselves, actualize themselves without being foreclosed by whichever object was in the valley, so to speak. It could be, of course, a real valley in a face-to-face setting for carbon-based life forms, or it could be a Silicon Valley for digital forms of expressions.

                        I wonder, given that here in the States we are an amalgamation of so many different cultures, races, languages, and ideologies, if there is a lack of social cohesion compared to a citizenry like Taiwan, which is predominantly Han Chinese, as I understand.

                        I was curious if you could speak to the potential of, at some point, diversity in ideologies not purely about races or backgrounds in terms of places of origin. In terms of ideologies or religious differences, is there a point at which perhaps here there isn’t a possibility of real social cohesion?

                        I think cohesion is overrated. It’s one of those ideas like harmonization of society. We don’t quite believe in harmonization of the society. That’s a nearby jurisdiction that’s more into it.

                        In Taiwan, I usually translate the official country name of the cabinet office, government that I’m currently in, which is in Mandarin [Mandarin] , as the Transcultural Republic of Citizens, Republic of Citizen as in [Mandarin], a country with its citizens as its foundation, and [Mandarin] being [Mandarin], literally in the middle of various flowers. It’s a transcultural view.

                        It’s not, “Let’s plant the same kind of flower and have it dominate the garden.” That idea was first developed by Sun Yat-Sen and his revolutionary friends to explain how to not entirely write off the Manchurian culture while having the ethnic Han working with the Manchurian culture that was the Qing dynasty, among other cultures, in a transcultural way, not in a assimilation kind of way.

                        That idea is universal. It doesn’t need to be Han and Manchurian. [laughs] It could be between any cultures. If one learned that, from different cultures, there are pieces of a puzzle that one offers to complete one another’s perspectives. One does not actualize one’s own upbringing unless you can actually view it from a very different culture than the one of your upbringing.

                        That’s also something like Ubuntu, the African equivalent, at work here. One actually actualizes through a larger community as opposed to the smaller community, and by contributing to it. Ubuntu, by the way, is also a very familiar term in Silicon Valley. [laughs]

                        Anyway, my point here is that transculturalism is the main thing that we’re having a perspective of the dialogue, and as long as the dialogue is around common values, I don’t think the different or varying positions is necessarily a bad thing. I think it actually contributes to the potential of the dialogue.

                        Yeah. That’s part of the takedown/lockdown side effect, the negative externality that it has on the society, and it’s not a new thing. Since ancient times, the way to combat either a pandemic or infodemic has been physical distancing, the closing of borders, lockdown of cities, suspensions of civic assembly, and mutual distrust seems to be inevitable.

                        There’s a sense of inevitableness if you do this kind of lockdown/takedown. Also, in such a more isolated mood, people are eager to blame the spread of the virus of the body or of the mind on outsiders, those of different races, different nationalities, different beliefs.

                        That leads then to an even more divisive virus of the mind, the us versus them kind of binary thinking that only grows with the pandemic and infodemic. It really is a self-reinforcing circle, but the circle can be broken.

                        It could be for example around intergenerational solidarity among, for example, Taiwan’s most controversial referenda. There was two referenda around marriage. The people who are older see marriage predominantly as something between two families, with each young person only acting as representative of their families.

                        The younger generations see marriage more as an individual to individual thing, which they now do by registration, and their family may or may not wed. That’s entirely up to the families themselves. I call these two views the in-laws view, and a by-laws view of marriage. [laughs]

                        I signify during that hot debate and two referenda that you see there’s a common value in both sides. Both sides want the institution of marriage to mean something. Both, they want maybe the divorce rate to decline instead of keep going up and up. Both sides want something meaningful, a family that’s going on in their lives. Otherwise, they would not debate marriage in the first place.

                        Ultimately, our so-called hyperlink act to legalize marriage equality is to rule that homosexual people, when they wed, they wed as individuals, hyperlinking to all the rights and duties, the parts in the civic code, but it hyperlinks to none of the codes in the in-law relationships, so their families do not become in-laws to one another on the legal code, and so on.

                        Literally, the tip of Taiwan grows two or three centimeters every year because of this tension, this earthquake, and the idea that, “I’m going to innovate no matter what the left-wing says or the right-wing says. I’m determinedly going up-wing.” I think this is something any individual can say to become a force of common value out of the divisiveness and tension.

                        Sunflower was in 2014, March. For three weeks, the occupiers demonstrated as a demo, not as a protest, but a little bit of protest, but most of it is a demo of how to listen to scale and come to rough consensus on the street.

                        For example, the rough consensus on the street at that time the major telecoms bidding for the spectrums to do the 4G infrastructure for wireless connections. The occupiers use WiMAX, by the way, which went nowhere, and so we had to do the 4G infrastructure over again.

                    <p>
                        People were wondering whether as part of the cross street service trade agreement, at that time being deliberated on the street because the MPs refused to delegate it, we would allow Beijing-based components in the 4G infrastructure. Interestingly, the rough consensus or the common value was one of an economic argument.

                        The argument goes that because it’s heavily state subsidized and may appear inexpensive at the beginning, but because we all know that down, the ruling party of the Chinese Communist Party [inaudible 32:25] can through this party branches to replace leadership for all the so-called private sector corporations that provides those 4G infrastructure equipments.

                        At each and every upgrade, we have to do another system risk assessment, to see whether this is now de facto state-owned or whether there are still some autonomy left in that company. It’s amortized. It’s a much higher business cost than just working with Nokia or Ericsson, and so on, which doesn’t have that problem of being taken over [laughs] by their state at any given moment in time.

                        People broadly come to consensus. The magic thing is that the head of Parliament eventually agreed with the occupiers and basically said, “OK. Let’s put a CSSTA on hold and start in national wide conversation around economic and trade as the occupiers demanded.” Out of it comes the e-participation platform, and so on.

                        I think the lessons learned then is that any mayoral candidate that support these consensus on the street gets elected at the end of that year. Sometime without an inauguration speech prepared, it’s surprising even to them. The mayor candidate no matter which party that did not support open governance didn’t get elected.

There was a conspiracy theory that says that the instant noodles aren’t going to run us then, and we all need to stockpile it, and so on. Then the premier, using the humor over rumor playbook immediately rolled out this huge cute scene banner.

Basically, it’s kind of paradoxical prescription. People buy because they fear that there will be a shortage and the premier is saying that buy as much instant noodle as you want.

In Taiwan social sanction works much more powerfully than any legal action that could be done by the government.

                        Facebook is basically faced with the choice of either conforming to the emerging social norm that any advertisements during elections/referenda need to be published as raw open data for independent people to analyze in real-time or they can decline from publishing these advertisements altogether during the election/referenda seasons.

                        They eventually chose the format and publish the ads library at a time in 2020, and end of 2019. The most transparent and real-time they’ve done anywhere in any other jurisdiction they were not deploying this kind of tailor-made code, but they understand the alternative would be strong social sanction.

                        That’s amazing. I hadn’t heard of that until you just mentioned it. I wonder if I have to look at any articles or news regarding that, so I can point people to that.

                        There is one more question I like to ask you while we have just a few more minutes. Maybe it’s a bit of a smaller [laughs] conspiracy theory inquiry. It has to do with people’s trust with technology as it pertains to contact tracing and digital fence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It seems as though I had been naively hoping that there would be some contact tracing consensus here, if not in the US, at least maybe in California or on the West Coast, or something. It seems as though people’s immediate jump into our state and federal governments cannot be trusted with our data. There’s going to be a central database.

                    <p>
                        There’s this kind of high tide, low tide wave crashing of clashing bits of information. There’s a very luke warm, barely any sort of contact tracing, as I understand it happening here. What is it that Taiwan was able to set up and in what kind of timeframe in terms of contact tracing, and how people took to that?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The timeframe is around a month work. When the CCC first set up, around mid-January, actually, the day before we even have a local confirmed case, and started their daily live-streaming the idea of contact tracers, who are always humans in Taiwan, by the way, [laughs] and not computers. Other computers used to be human too.

                    <p>
                        Anyway, [laughs] computer like edit are used to recruiting those. Contact tracers in Taiwan are always medical offices and the staff that work with medical offices. As a rule, we do not collect new data in the name of that pandemic. I think that’s the consensus both within the CCC and also on the street.

                        The reason is one of frugal innovation because the property of each new line of code is not to be trusted even by the cybersecurity auditors. It takes precious time to audit its cybersecurity and privacy implications.

                        On the other hand, there are already existing mechanisms for data collection, they’re just not very granular. For example, all the five major telecoms already know your phones whereabouts, but it’s not for tracking you, so it’s very rough. Even in the most densely packed urban areas is just 50 meter or so in radius.

                        It doesn’t know which block you’re in basically. It knows which part of district you’re in because they need this information to do roaming service to transfer from one telecom tower to another telecom tower while you’re moving fast by car to continue your call. They already collect that data. We already send out short text messages, seconds before a earthquake or minutes before a flood.

                    <p>
                        People are already getting this norm of they being in a wide area and not because we know precisely through GPS tracking or anything but just out of caution, sent a broadcast message to people roughly based on the telecom tower strength. They’re associated with a kind of one-way signal that tells them that there is danger in this area.

                        The Digital Fence which you described is built out entirely with these two existing mechanisms. There’s zero new data being collected. When you go back to Taiwan at a border, you can choose to go to a physical quarantine hotel, or you can stay at home if you have your own bathroom for 14 days.

                        If you don’t have a phone, we lend you a phone for 14 days. Otherwise, you can register your phone number and that’s all we need. If the phone moves out of that 50-meter-or-so radius, a SMS is sent to the local medical and police institutions to check your whereabouts. If you stay within that digital fence for 14 days, we pay you $100 a day as a stipend.

                        Of course, you can always leave your phone there, but if it doesn’t move for too long, a while, we send a SMS too, checking your temperature and so on. You’re required to respond to that SMS.

                        Anyway, if you break out of the quarantine, the fine is 1,000 times that daily stipend. You can fund 1,000 times most people in current scene. There’s a very few people break out of quarantine. We all understand at the end of the 14 days, there is no constitutional basis to continue to deploy this SMS notification.

That’s 91 percent of people’s approval rate, and the other 9 percent, we thank them for it because we’ve never declared state of emergency. We have to answer to the parliamentary interpolation.

                        When the Department of Cybersecurity’s head, [inaudible 53:43] , explained exactly how the digital fence works, how he partners with the five telecoms, how we do not collect new data, how they lock rotation is still in effect, so after 14 days, we know nothing about your cell phone signal strength, and so on, the approval rate grew to 94 percent, and of course we still thank the other 6 percent because they keep us honest and accountable.

                        Sure. That’s literally in my job description. [laughs] Back in 2016, when I first become digital minister, people keep confusing digital with IT. I keep saying that IT is machine talking to machines, and digital is how people talk to people.

                        Still, there’s a strong IT culture in Taiwan, so that it makes sense to delineate how digital of course is dependent on the ICT infrastructure, but it’s something else entirely.
