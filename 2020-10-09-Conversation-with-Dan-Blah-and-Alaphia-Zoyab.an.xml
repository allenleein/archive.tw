                        I’m up for giving a bit more of the origin story of Reset in my own words rather than the polish that is the website. Maybe that will give you some more questions and then maybe end with some very practical stuff about the open call and any questions or overview of where it is now and where we see it going in the next year.

                        It’s OK. It’s just surveillance capitalism and statism. Simple stuff.

                        I’m trying to ignore how heavy that problem is. That definitely is what drew me here. I’m Dan Blah. My real name is Dan Meredith. For the previous most of the last decade, I was working on Internet freedom at the Open Technology Fund.

                    <p>
                        One of the big limitations with that work was that we couldn’t really instigate more northern, western European actors to confront the issue that so much of what we were seeing happening in other countries, in repressive regimes, was being enabled by what was happening in surveillance capitalism for economic reasons with lack of policies in Europe and the US.

                    <p>
                        That was a major motivating factor for me wanting to work with Ben to create Reset and to get something that would try to rally that issue.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m a big believer of open calls and transparency, openness and free flow of knowledge exchange. A lot of what is baked into OTF is being brought over to Reset. You and I were talking briefly over email.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Dan Blah">
                    <p>
                        One of the differences is where OTF had a baked in process that everything had to go through an open call for any receipt of money, Reset is prioritizing that, but we can also work directly with people through who we know because it’s private funds. We get a little bit of best of those worlds.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        That’s my role or where I came into it. My role at Reset initially is working with Ben to set up all the proto infrastructure and bootstrap the thing and get it going.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, as Alaphia and Ben get more into their work of advocacy and policy respectively, mine is to work behind the scenes with research and technology to both enable and augment their work but ultimately make sure that any of the technology and research we’re doing is in direct service of an advocacy or policy plan.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Dan Blah">
                    <p>
                        The goal for Reset is better laws and/or litigation proof of laws in places that are affecting the globe around this issue of surveillance capitalism. We’re investing in tools and technology and original research. If it can’t be directly drawn to advancing that cause, it’s not worth doing.

                    <p>
                        Different than at OTF, where we hoped a lot of that happened, but we didn’t fund that directly. OTF worked with technology and hoped that the advocacy and policy people would come along and make use of it and gain advantages of that.

                        I just wanted to frame that that’s a bit of a head cognitive dissonance wrestling that I’m constantly going through, is how to be making sure the tech is in service of rather than “Oh, that’s a cool, glittery piece of technology. Let’s support it and do it.” That’s me.

                    <p>
                        Because I’m not yet, anyway, affiliated with Reset, I get to ask questions that might sound like conflict of interest after I get associated…

                    <p>
                        What about nonprofits like the Polis, now a charity. I’ve been working very closely with Polis, as you know, as a assistive intelligence technology that facilitates crowdsourced agenda setting, including the crowdlaw initiative and all that.

                    <p>
                        One thing I understand from the grant proposals that they’re working on is that there’s essentially two parts of it. One is the advocacy, the facilitation, and so on, that part, which sounds more like what Reset is doing and interested, but there’s the other, mundane part, which is just the software engineering and research and scaling. That’s the code level thing.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Without the code level thing, actually we can’t prove that this assistive intelligence is actually value aligning and accountable. The harder to fund part is actually a essential part, the reason of existence of the easier to fund part.

                    <p>
                        That’s not limited to Polis. We see this situation with the CONSUL Democracy Foundation and many other similar initiatives as well. What’s Reset’s position on this regard?

                        We don’t really want to choose any one…Before I talk about, I would say, the more mundane technology and research aspect of it, maybe this is a good spot for you, Alaphia, to jump in and describe your growing vision around advocacy and policy in the frame of that question.

                        Yeah, happy to. Really nice to meet you, Audrey. I did not know that Dan was already in touch with you. I happened to read about your work. I was like, “Well, we should definitely get in touch Audrey.” He was like, “I’ve got that covered.” Really nice to meet you.

                    <p>
                        I’ve been at Reset for a month and a half. I came from a global campaign group called Avaaz. In my last two years at Avaaz, we’d started working pretty heavily on the issue of disinformation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Alaphia Zoyab">
                    <p>
                        The reason we did that was because Avaaz, it’s a generalist group, so it campaigns on a range of issues. We had started to see pretty systematically that every single issue we worked on — whether it was climate change, environmental rights, human rights — every single issue was impacted heavily by the crisis in our information ecosystem, disinformation, and hate speech.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Alaphia Zoyab">
                    <p>
                        It was a natural progression for us to then work on disinformation. We started to see how alarmingly it was starting to impact elections around the world. That’s what brought me to the work.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Alaphia Zoyab">
                    <p>
                        I’m originally from India, and I have seen in the last two elections how the rapid explosion of disinformation and hate speech has seriously impacted a society where we once knew how to live with each other, tolerate each other, love each other, even, I would venture to say.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s been painful to watch. That’s one of the motivations of this work for me. I am a point where I did spend the two years that I did that disinformation work talking to the big platforms directly. It just became really clear to me that, in some ways, that’s pointless.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even when there are good people there — and there are many good people there — this thing is just too big for them to rein in and to bring under control. I am very passionate about the three pillars of what I think hopefully will be Reset’s work, which is regulation, legislation, and potentially litigation, but we shall see.

                    <p>
                        I’m not a technologist, so I think that, like Dan, I feel like you might be better placed to answer that question. I just wanted to lay out my motivations and Reset’s priorities, which is to work in countries where there’s legislative activity.

                    <p>
                        Right, but disinformation is a really good example. Just setting aside Polis as a vaccine against divisiveness through informed conversation and so on, just in the disinformation space itself, there are technologies that, if properly funded, will actually make real time response systems much more agile.

                    <p>
                        This is like in the early days of the spam fighting algorithms that, when advanced, it makes the spam issue not really go away, but it equips the multinationals, the mail providers, with this sense of how even the naïve Bayesian, the early 20th century machine learning, can actually put a check to the spam issue.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That enabled then the norm around the junk mail folders and the flagging email as spam. Then led to the targeting and the other technological measures, after which it became possible to bring, as you said, the regulations or the litigations.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There’s a clear way out, and that’s the norm we want to shape. Then we sue the mail providers that are negligent to the existing technologies that we can show convincingly that it’s a net win for everybody but the spammers involved.

                    <p>
                        Funding of those foundational technologies, like the security layers of the Internet, has long been in neglect, of course. I understand if Reset is mostly about looking at the landscape and advocating for the things that has been proven to work, instead of Dan just mentioned, which is more like Open Tech Fund, like the early stage incubation.

                    <p>
                        Like just funding a bunch of things and hope that one will work. My question was more around how mature in the readiness scale is the cutoff when you decide to start the regulation, advocacy, and litigation work to start saying, “OK, if a certain videoconference platform doesn’t do end to end encryption, we’ll just litigate against them.” That’s another example right there.

                        Dan, before you jump in, maybe I can take that from another angle, which is that ultimately, I think that we will want to campaign on these issues as well. We want to shift public opinion on the big question of surveillance capitalism.

                        I don’t have a whole lot more to add to that. I would just say that I think one of the goals and the thing that excites me about working with you, Audrey, is that you can help us define what is worth investing in that’s mature. Then what isn’t worth investing in that might be more nascent and new?

                    <p>
                        Where you see a gap in policies that don’t exist but technology that address that social problem, and you see Reset as squarely fit within that, yes. Then vice versa, where you see us looking to support something that clearly has a regulatory answer.

                        From a value proposition, in your expertise, it obviously makes more sense to go down a policy advocacy litigation. Like, “Let’s fight this with law, not just inventing a new piece of technology.” Then the point of the Strategy Network Council, advisory council, or councilmembers writ large, is to make sure that we’re following the right currents.

                        We’re getting pulled there, because we couldn’t do it on our own. What I’m really excited about is you just asked the fundamental question that’s going to be driving Reset for as long as we’re around. How do we get that balance right?

That was where Reset, Ben and I’s eyes, we didn’t really want to start going until we had the three of our positions representing those three underlying types of work for those pillars.

                        I would be inclined to go towards some of the mechanics of the open call, because I’m really excited about some of the underlying technologies and things there. Do you have any questions at all of high level strategy, vision, remit of Reset, before I get into that?

                        No. It sounds quite clear. Actually, that with the infodemic, as known by people, instead of doing the mis/mal/dis-information dance, now, it’s just known as the twin crisis of pandemic and infodemic.

                        Which as a good ring to it, actually, because we’re essentially taking then a vaccination approach toward the infodemic, and not necessarily this administrative shutdown vision. The people understand how bad it feels to be under lockdown.

In that way, it’s baked in from the start to be something where there is a clear set of policies, guides, principles, and questions that can change and iterate very quickly based on feedback.

We just don’t have enough money yet. Even if we do have more money, it’s still going to be one percent or less of people that apply, because of just this issue and the excitement that gets around it.

From your own personal research perspective, if you hear or someone comes to you and says, “Oh, I applied to Reset. It didn’t really happen,” and you wanted to have some insight to, what was our rationale for that?

                        It will be really useful for, as a seed for other initiatives globally, to do some of Reset’s work to be able to make use of the proposal data and any information that Reset has. We really want to give that to you with the understanding that this is for you to do what you will with under best practices of data sharing and all these other things to use it and advance the cause in any way that you think can.

                        It doesn’t even need to be implemented. Of course, I think there’s two part of it. One is this vested power for just a handful of people to quadratically vote. That’s one model. The other model is, of course, more crowdsourced, but with maybe less voting powers for the community, which has a bootstrapping problem. We can solve that.

                        The funny thing about this is, here’s…I love it. You really got right to the nerve. At OTF, because we were government funded, the idea of expanding the underlying software called Hypha that runs this to be something more than just a decision process for compliance purposes, we couldn’t ever justify investing funds into those features.

                        I checked the bylaws of the public servants here, and it seems that, if this is not a post, then, of course, I can do reviews. That’s entirely fine. I can accept honorariums up to 5,000 NT dollars per hour — that’s the ceiling.

                        Definitely. I will just bill it as a single transaction for this round, of course, of open call. That’s kosher, and as long as it’s transparent — which it is, we’re making a transcript right now — that is fine.

                        I don’t usually do downvotes. It’s a personal thing. Maybe I will just give qualitative reviews on things that I don’t like. I can leave reviews on how to make it better, but I don’t really like doing downvotes without this whole quadratic voting thing.

                        If we have QV, I can give it one point to show that it has potential, and basically treating it as, “I’ve read this.” Then with just upvote and downvotes, there is no such spectrum to be made, so which I will just skip… I will do the qualitative part.

                        I will do two things. I will make sure they’re not required, because they might be required right now. I haven’t actually used them yet, but I think that’s the default. Then if it is a setting that for right now is limited by needing to be required, I’ll just make sure there’s a maybe. You can put maybe or pass. You don’t have to do a downvote.

                        I’m throwing a very open question to you about what are some of trends in Asia that we really should be paying attention to in the context of surveillance capitalism? That’s one. It’s a big, broad question. I’m aware of that.

                    <p>
                        The second is I am thinking about an open call, not for technology, but in some ways to invite communities that are impacted by the harms of surveillance capitalism, to apply and to be able to document and build the evidence base of the harms in their particular context.

                    <p>
                        The reason I’m excited by that idea is because, in the past, a couple of years ago, we launched a whole hate speech project off the back of just one stray comment from a community member who just said, “You know, it’s really weird. As the government does this citizenship census count, we’re seeing a massive spike in hate speech against particular minorities.”

                        That led to a whole workstream and proper documentation, and we unearthed quite a bit. I want to find those people, but I don’t know what I don’t know. In some ways, I don’t know who to approach. That’s my second question, which is what are some…Where and who are some of these communities that we should also be paying attention to?

                        I don’t have a good answer to the second question. That’s really not my forte. I will just be frank and say that. In Taiwan, the Doublethink Lab would be the people that you should talk to who are actually in that trade and do some pretty good, along with Graphika and the usual suspects, on hate speech/disinformation/election interference studies.

                        For the first question, I think really, in Asia, the main thing is surveillance state capitalism. There really is no escaping that.

                        It’s the data norm that’s conveniently called, I think, the rule by law, instead of the rule of law, norm that’s established by the People’s Republic of China regime. That has a capitalist shell, but then it’s statism underneath at its core.

                    <p>
                        Then through Belt and Road, through state subsidized telecommunication system, through all sorts of various different things, they gain traction much as surveillance capitalism would, but with subsidized state backing. That makes it even worse.

                    <p>
                        That’s really the thing in Asia. I’m sure you’re already familiar with that. Actually, at this very moment, my digital double is giving a talk with Oslo Freedom Forum folks and Stanford on this particular regard, on how to react as democracies, and not overreact to the PRC’s position as an authoritarian intelligence — “AI” — superpower.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I know a bit more about that particular regard than hate speech. We can have a more in depth talk, but this is on everybody’s mind. Many Asian jurisdictions don’t choose the PRC vendors for 4G or 5G — or other tech stack — because they like authoritarianism, but rather because there’s a path dependency. It’s state subsidized by the PRC, so it’s inexpensive. The data norm? Well through the “rule by law”, it looks like a regulation behind it.

                        What, of course, they often forget is that there is no appeal process, and no accountability, which makes it as good as the great leader in the closest party branch. That’s the reality around here.

                    <p>
                        That is, I think, in everybody’s mind. When we do our usual end to end encryption code and things like that, we all have that in mind. Like when Zoom conveniently suspended people’s accounts because they said something that may offend people who don’t like Tiananmen being mentioned in the communication. Or that they can with a misconfiguration, according to them, reroute the traffic.

                        However, we’re not simply saying “Zoom is bad, ban them” — we’re saying we need to keep putting pressure on them on true end-to-end encryption, which they are now working on with the Keybase folks. That their web client also needs to go through independent audit — so we won’t have to install their desktop software.

                        Anyway, back to surveillance capitalism. There are ways to advocate, to regulate, and to litigate, but in this part of the world, we always assume that there is a state behind the surveillance capitalism if it looks like it goes through the physical route to any of the PRC territories, either de facto or du jour.

You mentioned audit, and actually, that’s something that I think would, we’d greatly benefit from your expertise, which is, one of the policy objectives that we’re advancing, trying to emphasize, to regulate as rulemakers, is that they have to have powers to audit and inspect the algorithms.

                        A couple of things. Why I like Polis so much is that it’s machine learning, but it’s 20th century machine learning. It’s not deep. It use only very easy to explain, even to middle schooler, algorithms, principal component analysis, k means clustering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Anyone with middle school mathematics can verify how it works using open data, versus a deep learning transformer infrastructure. That may be opaque, even to the people who code them. I think there’s a great difference between with AI with 20th century technologies that we can audit, and AI with 21st century technologies that the technologists themselves cannot audit.

                        I think there’s a lot to be said of using tried and true 20th century technologies. That’s the first part. Then the second part is about mathematical properties. If you design with the privacy in mind, with auditability in mind, there is, with an expense in computational cost, there is new materials in mathematics.

                        Zero knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryptions, split learning, if you have to use deep learning, and things like that that are provably private or provably secrecy keeping. Differential privacy is a good example.

                        You can specify a privacy budget, and it’s proven not to exceed that privacy budget. What I am trying to say is that, unlike the ad hoc audits that’s more like looking at a complex machinery and try to calculate its carbon emissions, do instead starting from the primitives, and design things to be emission free, or emission up to a certain epsilon, or even carbon capturing.

                        Anyway, and then, using only those primitives, then you can be sure that you have a zero waste or zero emission plants. I mean the industrial kind. I think this is the idea of privacy first design. If we don’t have that as a primitive in our regulations and able to enforce it through an independent data protection authority, then all hope is lost.

                        Ad hoc auditing is just like reverse engineering. You can’t really do it to any scale. Of course, very good white hat hackers can penetration test anything through reverse engineering, but we don’t want to make that the entry barrier toward making any publicly useful software.

                        Old, tried and true primitives, or deep learning and stuff, but with a good mathematical primitive, and build only using those primitives. These are the two pathways toward auditability by design. That’s why the end to end encryption thing is so important, because that’s one of the things that the public actually understand now.

                        It’s a good first test toward auditability of end to end and forward secrecy in communication, because that’s what people care about. It’s that they will not be eavesdropped in the future. That sounds wrong, like “Tenet.” Anyway, you know what I mean.

                        I was just going to add a couple weird antidotes. One is like where functional programming, functional machine learning, functional algorithms built, I think that that’s like…

                        I’m totally bridging very bad analogies, but how do you ensure that there’s a clear primitive for the policy that you’re putting in place as well that’s grounded in some sort of research or evidence based?

                        That’s how it’s supposed to be. It doesn’t often work that way, but Reset is trying to come up with the policy component to both auditing and other, more responsible algorithmic machine learning models, how do you make sure that you can stand by both of them being built on real evidence based and primitives?

                        I think that that’s one aha. Then I was just going to say, Audrey, your position about the tried and true, I have been astounded in the last two to three years about how many folks who, like machine learning, data scientists, experts, have all come to that same conclusion.

                        Where they’re like, “We got into grad school, or we went to a company, and we were so motivated by coming up with the cool, new model that we didn’t think existed that was going to do something.” Then after they became more informed, they realized that actually, that was dangerous.

                        That there was so much tried and true within existing models, algorithms, and mathematical functions that did exist that were being underleveraged that we knew were safe. Now, they’re moving towards more of that.

                        It’s like, what’s your decision trees, for which things do you want to use that are tried and true? Rather than go straight to the cool, new — a bad analogy, but — sexy thing that would get everyone really excited, because it’s glittery and new. That could be very harmful.

                        Instead of tried and true, deep learning models could be untried and fake. [laughs] It’s remarkably easy to fake, actually, with all due respect. Sometimes it’s called overfitting.

                        I think the coprocessor thing, that code is law and law is code, is one of those easy to understand but hard to legislate ideas. The most success I’ve seen is all about almost like contract law, but also, there’s a part of the criminal code, like unsafe driving, that are very mechanical in nature. You can build a good dual of it in its digital twin.

                    <p>
                        For the kind of legislation that we’re looking at for Reset, which is more about algorithmic safety, I don’t know, fire inspections or whatever, things like that, I think there really need to be a clear delineation between the coprocessable, like embarrassingly parallel, embarrassingly called auditable part and the part that requires human judgment.

                    <p>
                        Then the human judgment part, just like any environment impact assessment, is, of course, still science and evidence based, but code does not substitute for human judgment there, because each environment protection agency may work on the same scientific principle — well I’m sure they work on the same scientific principle — but the norm around what’s pollution and what’s not, what’s tolerable and what’s not, what’s long term thinking… Some jurisdiction may think four years is long term thinking, and some jurisdiction thinks seven generations is long term thinking. That affects their decision on the environmental impact assessment, too.

                        I really want to get you and Pia together to talk about, when do we start passing legislation that allows for more fluidity in those decisions? Where it’s like, it’s so hard for the subjective stuff to pass a law that results in a contract that the government has to hold.

                        With quadratic voting and more real time assessment of where is the populous at right now but still avoiding populism swings, you could end up in a situation where a change in temperament from society, enshrined by a law requiring this vote, changes the individual contracts that agencies, companies, and society, ultimately, abides by.

                        Maybe not liquid democracy — maybe natural personhood? It sounds more like natural personhood, like giving a river or a mountain a legal seat at a table, through re-presentational algorithms, essentially, to prove that this poor decision harms the river, so the river can sue for damage as a legal person.
