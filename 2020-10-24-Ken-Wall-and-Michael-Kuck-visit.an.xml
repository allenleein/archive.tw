                    <p>
                        I’m Ken. I came to Taiwan via acquisition originally, and I came back to Taiwan in order to work on product and innovation at Gogoro.

                        I’m Michael. I came to Taiwan originally because of my then-girlfriend, now wife. I am the tech lead, and I also co-founded a startup here in Taiwan called InLine.

                    <p>
                        Let’s do the two-minute pitch here. What we’re focused on is a solution in the climate space. I’m pretty sure I don’t need to spell out the magnitude of the challenge.

                    <p>
                        Well, yeah, exactly. There’s a growing number of people who are more and more concerned about this, but the thing is that the vast majority of them have no idea what they can do to make it happen. There’s some people who do. They’re fighting for systematic change.

                        They say you can’t get to systematic change, or you don’t usually, until you have about 25 percent of the population who really cares and who’s willing to take action on something.

                    <p>
                        That leaves us asking the question, “What about the 99 percent of us?” What do you do with all the people…

                        That’s basically what our focus is, is how can we help these people? The angle that is to make it as easy and motivational as possible for people to make better climate decisions.

                        That’s true. That’s true. That’s possible. User does whatever they want to. Where we identify an opportunity where they can make a better environmental decision, then we draw their attention to it.

                        Wouldn’t the customer say, “I have to download a lot of data about all the airline quality reports and things like that. Wouldn’t that be a lot of load on my hard disk,” or something like that?

                        It’s decentralized, so the customer installs something very lightweight, and when we send any data, it’s anonymous.

                    <p>
                        Right, but I think the foundation of what we’re building is trust. We need to be transparent what we log, if we log it, and we need to be clear what we don’t, or what we’re not interested in. IP addresses, for sure, is not something we’re interested in.

                        I bring this up, because even if you are open source, there really is no way to ensure you’re not logging the IP addresses.

                        What if someone asks, “Can we have an in-house, on-premises server that I can reconfigure this plugin to talk to? Instead of to your servers, I want a bunch of static JSON, perhaps, just hosted somewhere in the intranet”?
                    </p>

                        In such restrictive environments, they are not allowed to make HTTP requests, other than to whitelisted domains, anyway. We have a very strong mandate to promote sustainability awareness, and so that’s actually a real question, is that is it possible to configure, that it goes to an on-premises server that I just clone it off GitHub or something?

                    <p>
                        I think that’s definitely something we need to consider in the future. I think, as a starting point, not right now, but if we want to scale bigger, definitely. I think that’s very interesting.

                        Yeah, definitely. I was also very happy to see the changes in Safari, which now supports Chrome extensions almost out of the box. Safari on mobile, that’s super exciting. I didn’t know. I will definitely check it out, probably today.

                        All that stuff is obviously really important and very helpful. If we end up building out some kind of trusted presence, some kind of trusted brand, then we’re hoping to have the good problem solve.

                        Of course, you can. The Presidential Hackathon winners win because they mobilize tens of thousands of people. The scan thing, the top topping thing is one thing. The other thing is this Feng Cha thing, which is the tea-serving app.

                        What it does is that it shows you how many plastic bottles you have saved by choosing to use refill stations. Hey, we are in a Social Innovation Lab which has a refill station that offers three different water temperatures.

                    <p>
                        You can just have a, I don’t know, conversation with people around you that also cares about saving plastic bottles. The great thing is that they designed it like PokÃ©mon Go, so if you keep checking in every day, eventually, you get a sufficient number of points. That actually gets you some tea.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s called Feng Cha, or the tea-serving app. The company is called Circuplus. I think it’s C-I-R-C-U-P-L-U-S, Circuplus. Yeah. Just this one, they recruited more than 8,000 people. Not too bad.

                    <p>
                        For the mobile factor, I think this is really good, because then it becomes a platform upon which that you can push, I don’t know, heat warmings, drink water. It ties in, definitely is this. Also, more informed choices.

                        Whether it’s the barcode-scanning app, the tea-serving app, and so on, they’re based on the same thing, which is to make the external environmental cost apparent, explicit. As long as your values are aligned, I think you can just work like on a machine-to-machine API and reuse these existing, trusted endpoints, instead of just building your own Line bot or something.

                        Yeah, I think the main thing that’s required in Taiwan is just to work with an established brand that has social trust. As I mentioned, if you say you are not looking the IP addresses and secretly selling it to advertisers, there’s bound to be someone that’s already trusted that goes out and says, “Hey, we use their API, and they’re a trustworthy bunch.

                        “They even allowed us to rebuild the Docker files. After inspecting the server code, even though it’s not open source, we did inspect the server code, and it’s very kosher,” and so on. Something equivalent to that must be…

                        All the teams, the Circuplus one, the barcode-scanning one, so on, and so forth, these are Presidential Hackathon champions that has this social street credibility. I think that’s the first step, and then I think it’s a good idea.

                        Oh, really? OK, that’s awesome. There’s going to be a very large summit in Tainan around the end of the year, the g0v Summit. That’s where all the developer communities, not just in Taiwan, but I believe from abroad as well, is going to get here.

                        Sometimes virtually, of course, this being 2020, but [laughs] at least their attention is here. There’s any number of unconferences. If you haven’t submitted a talk, maybe you can do an unconference. If you go to the summit website, I think it’s December 6th.

                        Yours truly will also be there to talk about defending democracy, very exciting stuff. Then there’s any number of unconferences where you can just mingle with people and just recruit. Most people who are there have done something like that already, like the News Culpa, which is a disinformation-fighting Chrome plugin.

                        There’s one about labor law violations that’s displayed on 104-1111, those job hunting websites, and so on. There’s many g0v people that have done already, in some sort, the same kind of thing you’re doing, except it’s on the social, not the environment, purposes. That will save a lot of onboarding time, I hope.
