                    <p>
                        We wanted to begin with your philosophy, the philosophy behind some of the things that you’re doing. You have described yourself as a “conservative anarchist.” What does that mean?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Certainly. To conserve is to respect the traditions. In Taiwan, we have more than 20 national languages, each with their own cultural lineages. To make “progress” in one culture may very well be a kind of epistemic injustice against the other 20 different national languages and cultures.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        By “conservative” I mean to adapt the technology to the society rather than asking the society to adapt to technology. That’s what I mean.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It draws a lot from the indigenous nations’ notions of sustainability, and indigenous people’s sense of a spirit, like the Saviah or Patungkuonʉ, the top of Taiwan, the mountain is itself a spirit, and we are ephemeral actors who work to conserve the spirit. That is what I mean by the conservative part.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The anarchist part is more related, of course, to Internet’s end-to-end principle, meaning that the wisdom is at the edges, at each individual end. No one in the middle can or should have a say in what the edges have invented or innovated to communicate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s basically switching from coercive power to an end-to-end principle, which is essentially a power that’s based on rough consensus. It’s based on deliberation, based on the general understanding that the earlier innovators must not restrict the innovations of later innovators.

                        Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send. Liberal in what you accept. That are all core, the Postel’s law, core Internet principles that shaped the early Internet. Of course, it’s relevant. It’s still very relevant.

                        This is Peter: We’re running this interview together in our own kind of Taoist exercise, I suppose. How’s it been like taking those principles, especially the early Internet philosophy, and then moving that into actual policymaking? Is it possible to translate those ideas?

                        Maybe I don’t know the…I know the philosophy of the early Internet superficially, just from John Perry Barlow, the former Grateful Dead singer and stuff, and it’s literally anarchist sometimes.

                        They basically are given a space to form rough consensus, to work out loud, to publish not only the end result of policy-making, but the process of the making of the policies by listening at scale to citizens, and so on.

                        At the end of the day, I do not give them command, and they do not give me orders, either. This is what I mean by working with the government on one side, and of course the social movements on the other. I’m kind of like Lagrange point between the social movements on side, and the governments on the other.

                    <p>
                        Fine. That already sounds a lot like the philosophy that we’re talking about, but in terms of vision of the Internet, is there a role for the state in it then? How does one make sure that that role is never coercive and is always…?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Anne Applebaum">
                    <p>
                        Also, by setting up these projects, by setting up Polis or vTaiwan, isn’t that an intervention of the state, or how do you describe what you’re doing there? Is that, you’re creating a framework…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It’s a people-public-private partnership. The order, very important. Always, the norm is set by the social sector. That is to say, the people, variously called the voluntary sector, the third sector, the civic sector, the civil society, etc., but I will say social sector for the sake of the conversation, because it rhymes better with social innovation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Anyway, the social sector sets the norm. For example, around countering infodemic, the fact-checkers set the norm. Around, for example, the targeted advertisements on social media, that actually has a antisocial externality when it comes to election, and the social sector sets the norm of radical transparency of campaign donation expenditure.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I can go on, but the point is that the social sector sets the norm. Then the public sector amplify the norm by essentially saying that, “We found that the social sector now has a norm that says, for example, during the elections, all the campaign donation expenditure are to be published as open data, not just open data, but rather open API as quick as possible, as structured as possible.”
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That enable us to essentially do a negotiation with, say, Facebook saying, “If you don’t want to be labeled antisocial media and face social sanction, it is actually in your best interest if you publish campaign advertisements exactly like campaign donations.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is to say limited to only domestic contributors, and also publish the exact terms, like algorithmic transparency in real time for independent social sector journalists to analyze.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If they don’t do so, we don’t really have jurisdiction over them, but they will face social sanction. This is the state’s role to amplify the norm that’s set and agreed by the social sector, and to make sure that it can also reach other stakeholders in Internet governance so that they can act in a prosocial rather antisocial way.

                        They ignored it. It was very hard to access, there was no way to prove that they were doing it openly. It wasn’t even clear that the public was that interested in it when it appeared. A few little NGOs worked on it, and it had almost no impact.

                        We’re aware of that. Actually last December, when Facebook put a lot of resources into the civic integrity, we’re aware that Taiwan is probably the first jurisdiction that they actually did what they claimed that they would do in Europe.

                        Like boycotting, like people actually going to, say, PTT or the vCard, or any of those alternatives run by other players who, like PTT, have already signed up to these social sector norms. Basically they would be seen as the odd entity out.

                        If everybody else agree that this is the norm, then people would just maybe publicly delete their Facebook accounts if Facebook continued to not respect the local norm. Our government – the control branch is a separate branch in the government – published the campaign donation expenditure previously also only as statistics in a very difficult to understand format.

                        Thanks to the citizen activist, hacktivist even, that went to the Control Yuan, brought out photocopies and did a OCR, a massive crowdsourcing project to turn these into CSVs, into independently reportable numbers.

                    <p>
                        That also partly enabled the independent investigative journalist to discover that the majority of campaigns did not file their social media advertisements budget as campaign donation or expenditure, essentially creating a loophole in the political process.

                        When their petition and activism became the new law in 2018’s election, that’s the first time that the control unit adhered to this social sector norm. Everybody see that it actually made things much more transparent, and then it left people asking why is Facebook not catching up?

                        The fact that the social sector sets the norm and pressure the public sector to accept that first as an example, and then later on, the social sector, social media, all joined and would indeed single out Facebook if they are the only platform that didn’t do it, it create enormous pressure based on the social plus public sector norms.

                        There are alternatives also, because the PTT or, really, vCard, or Plurk, or whatever, they are real competitors to Facebook. Also, like the PTT, although we call it the Taiwanese equivalent of Reddit, it’s actually different because the PTT is run essentially by National Taiwan University students in their spare time as an exercise in open source governance.

                        The entire PTT regulatory framework is open source, and the code for PTT is also open source, enabling participatory accountability. That is the norm in Taiwan. Anything that falls short of this norm automatically have less legitimacy. That probably cannot be said in the whole of EU.

                    <p>
                        Also, I’m thinking like, you’re talking about the social sector as a unified body that everyone seems to trust and represents everyone. I can just imagine in America, where civil society is already a polarized term, civil society is seen, sadly, as only representing one part of society.

                    <p>
                        Yes, because the social sector really grew in Taiwan even during the martial law, working on, of course, charity projects and so on. Because we have lots of earthquakes, typhoons, and so on, and that really mobilized the entire social sector to essentially fulfill the role of governments even before the democratization.

                        During the democratization, you can see it’s the co-ops, the local community colleges, and so on that essentially prototype how democracy could actually work so that we have a very peaceful democratization.

                        Because a lot of those fair, trusted NGOs cut their teeth on the social issues in the ‘70s and ‘80s, but our first presidential election was in ‘96, so that means that the state has a massive deficiency when it comes to the time that it takes to earn legitimacy.

                        It does a little bit of define because it defines the rough consensus, the resonating affect, the resonating ideas, but that’s all it does. Everything after that, like actually discussing over that agenda set by the Polis, is still for the professional politicians to convene such multistakeholder forums.

                        Of course, Polis can help, because you can invite the people who propose the best ideas or the most controversial ideas to the table. Basically, make the plurality of voices more plural, but everything that follows afterwards, after the define stage there comes the development and the delivery.

                        When we say it’s journalism, it means a strict subset of text that has its own social norm around it, around fact-checking, around framing, around biases, around the integrity of the journalistic profession about the internal ethics of the journalist as part of their training and things like that.

                        This, for a lack of better term, I refer to as competence. Just as a journalist would have media competence – that’s a better word than media literacy, by the way – a so-called data curator or data producer need to have digital competence in the sense that they are aware of the limits of the technologies.

                        Right. For example, is this about the common sensing of the environment? If this is about us measuring the air quality together so we can have a more clear picture about not only pollution but also Climate Change, then we just call it exactly that.

Then people will not confuse it with, for example, the health records, because there is nothing in common between the PM2.5 values measured by the AirBox and the health record that you put into the trust of your doctor.

                        Again, I would think in terms of not consumers, because in a sense, we are not consumers. We are producers. It’s just through those intermediary platforms, different producers are paired into each other’s so-called news feed, having no journalistic…

                        They keep redefining those words, so feeds. I will just call them feeds. Those producers of media are paired to each other’s feeds, so we can share what each other have produced. In no point here is a traditional consumer relationship defined because first of all, I didn’t pay for any of these things.

                        The second thing is that I’m not tuning into a radio or a television. I’m not merely receiving things, I am constantly interacting. Indeed, it is the interaction pattern that allows the profiling. I don’t think the term consumer is at all useful when we talk about Facebook.

                        Now, with that in mind, I do think that Facebook, like any co-governor – this is the term that I use – they may not have sovereignty because they have not yet printed their own money, although they did certainly try. They are a co-governor when it comes, for example, to election campaigns because a lot of money flows into it to get visibility.

                        In that sense, they are a campaigner, or at least a co-governor that can regulate how campaigners work. Because they have their own jurisdiction over the algorithm, even though there’s no appeal process…Although there is the oversight board, but maybe one percent of the things go to the oversight board.

                        The other 99 percent is completely arbitrary, so we need to essentially treat it as a trade negotiator would in the sense that there is a rule-setter. It has overlapping jurisdiction on many cases.

                        We are in the process of translating GDPR to our jurisdiction. There are, of course, a lot of structural differences. For example, what we call the, as I mentioned, civil IoT system is called called joint data controllership in GDPR.

                        The GDPR clauses on joint data controllership is quite thin and ill-defined. That it’s actually hard to see how the existing civic union work on data gathering and so on in Taiwan can map cleanly to the joint data controllership clauses.

                        Exactly. That is actually quite powerful in international trade. If people agree on common principles, that allows them to form a trade partnership on particular goods and services. Indeed, I’m not saying that this is purely a trade issue, but internationally speaking, this could be modeled as a trade issue.

                        Audrey, we’ve been talking a little bit about these American companies, but of course, the other big challenge is China. You’re right on the edge of that. To what extent do you frame or do you think about your vision of how Internet and democracy should work together vis-à-vis the Chinese challenge?

                    <p>
                        It seems to me quite an insidious challenge, in many ways, not least because, in its own weird way, the Chinese internet is an efficient Internet. It seems to be, anyway. It seems to deliver services to people. It’s not open about its oppression. You’re much closer to it. What are its strengths and weaknesses?

                        One of the things that I think is quite clear is that they use some of the same words that we use to mean opposite things. I already talked about transparency of the state versus transparency to the state.

                        Right, so that’s another thing. There’s laws. There’s rules, but it means different things. Also, for example, in Taiwan, when we say something, that this person have a lot of social credit, it means nothing about the government, but rather about essentially credit unions, which is a thing in Taiwan.

                        Two things going on here. The first is that the journalistic norm around reporting means that, for example, if Facebook, who publicly signed on this counter-disinformation accord, along with other social media organizations, companies, and so on, didn’t do so, it will be very visible.
                    </p>

                        There’s any number of public dashboards tracing not only what Facebook is doing, but also how Line, an end-to-end encrypted media that nevertheless is doing the same to allow for fact-checking to go even into end-to-end encrypted conversations.

                        If you long-press a message that you receive from me and send it to fact-checking, Line will do that. It is like flagging email as spam. It doesn’t encroach on the privacy of the email. Basically, by reporting something as spam, you are dedicating this to the Spamhaus, I think, the international social sector for analysis.

                        That’s the first thing. It’s based, again, on watchdog organizations in the social sector and the implicit threat of social sanction if they do not do what they claim they are doing. That’s the first thing.

                        The second thing is that if we see the fact-checkers’ notices, of course, that does not automatically win people over. Another strategy that we deploy is called humor over rumor, making sure that people also have the information presented to them, the scientific information sometimes, saying that, “Wear a mask to protect yourself from your own unwashed hands.”

                        They’re not paid by the state. No, they’re not paid by the state. Of course, for example, I publicly blessed the Unstoppable Happy Party, but I also made it clear that it’s not an endorsement. I’m not joining their political party.

                        I’m just saying that the digital communication strategy need the social sector to act in a particular way for that to happen. Not only do the government need to show restraint by, for example, not running government-owned fact-checking services.

                        Also, if the social sector can actually make things fun, there is less pressure for the government to adopt any authoritarian measures.

                        Audrey, all this, it sounds exciting. In this brief conversation, we’ve gone through regulatory measures. We’ve gone through security issues. We’ve gone through content creation. Clearly, your philosophy, I can see how it works in all those things.

                        It’s a ray of sunshine listening to it, because our situation is so dark and so negative. How sustainable is it? How vulnerable is it? Even as we’re talking, I could see so many ways this could be undermined. Will the next government do it? Is this just you?

                        It’s definitely not just me. All the four political parties – not including the Can’t Stop This Party because they don’t have parliamentary members – all the four main parties in our parliament have signed on the Open Parliament Accord and are working quite closely with the open government principles and so on.

                        Like the previously, in 2014, right after the occupy, all the mayors that supported this engagement, open government idea got elected, sometimes surprisingly. Everybody who didn’t, didn’t. People compete on how more engaging and radically transparent one can be. To my knowledge, none of the four major parties is against this trend.

                        That’s what we are doing. If you look at po.pdis.tw, or just go to digitalminister.tw, and click open government, you can find a set of ready-made regulations, if you want to transplant it somewhere else.

                        For example, the Tainan Municipal Government did just take that from our central government and realize it in a more municipal fashion, but I’ve really got to go.
