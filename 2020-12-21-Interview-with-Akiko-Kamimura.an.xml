                </heading>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Recently you have wowed Japan and the rest of worldwide with your leadership on the coronavirus crisis. You have made amazing system of mask map and supplying them fairly and immediately. I have heard that there was a system that combined the wisdom of young civilians, software engineers. What do you think three key factors in your success of this mask map project?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The three factors are fast, fair, and fun.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Three “F”s?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes. The idea from the civil society as soon as the first map appears in 24 hours, we in the government started discussing whether it’s better for us to work wisdom instead of just for the people. Instead of for the people, with the people, this enabled a very quick response.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Within a week, we decided that we will use those maps, not our own website to offer the real time availability. This is very fast. This is also very fair, because if we said only Howard, only the first person, can be the vendor like a normal procurement, it will be unfair to people who cannot use a map.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        For example, very old people who prefer to use voice assistance because they don’t see very well, or people who are on the Line platform, they don’t want to open a browser. They would prefer a chatbot. By providing the open API fairly to all social and commercial vendors, we stay neutral to all other possibilities. This is very fair.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Finally, it is a lot of fun. We worked with many professionals, who use a very chromatic approach to spread this communication. A very cute dog, for example, explained, “You wear a mask to protect yourself from your own unwashed hands.” This is very memorable. People will look at this dog who is really very cute.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, very cute.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Then think about not do this, not push, wear a mask to prevent from doing this. This whole mask map is based on communication. That’s fun. Because it’s fun, people will share it to other people on social media. The correct information spread wider than to false this information.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        The idea of social innovation, you realizing that kind of system, brings a new way of thinking. What is the obvious difference between the old-style way of working and the new style of working, do you think?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The main difference is in social innovation, it’s everyone’s business with everyone’s help. In the old style is, for example, only the government’s business and only with the help by vendors, by people who are in a procurement relationship with the government. With social innovation, anyone can help because it’s everyone’s business.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        How do you think that the relationship between company organizations or employers and individuals will change in this coming feature?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In the modern culture, many people are slashy, meaning that they are something, slash something, slash something, like I’m digital minister.tw/board member of radical exchange/digital future society member/ [laughs] console foundation member, and so one.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Although, of course, there are still companies and organizations just as a company will work with many people, each individual also work with many companies. It become many-to-many relationship.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        I think it’s very different from the past. Maybe 20 years or even 10 years ago, the lifetime employment system is quite common here in Japan. Is it different from Taiwan?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        In Taiwan, more than 90 percent are small and medium enterprises. Entrepreneurship and also this slashy relationship is much more common, but even in Japan because of teleworking.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        This year, many people work through the Internet. That means they also have more free time either to take care of their family, or to contribute to the community, or if they want, work on another job. Tele-working also makes this easier.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        OK. You said that it is important for everyone, regardless of nation or culture, to take various opinion in order to survive on the Earth as one team forever. I think terms like inclusion, or diversity, equality are bit too trendy. I think they are kind of get-out-of-jail-free card words. What does inclusion mean to you in your theory?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        To me it means take all the sides. No matter how many color there is, I can take all the different sides. Taking different sides, this is easier to remember than diversity and inclusion, which is more abstract.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Good. Thank you. How did you come up with the idea? Did you have any experience to be conscious about inclusion or diversity?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Definitely. When I dropped out of high school in 1996 when I was 15…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        When you were 14?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        …there was a lot of exclusion that I experienced. I’m not of the age to vote. I don’t even have access to college libraries if they check my age. There are many places that are closed to people under 18 years old. It should be the same in Japan because I’m not yet an adult.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        To me, I can already contribute a lot to science and research. Online, nobody know I’m just 15 years old. People worked with me on the merit of my ideas. I experienced the Internet governance which is inclusive as opposed to the democratic representation system, which for a 15 year old is very excluded.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Excluded, yeah. Did your decision to leave school at 14 shock your family? I have read your parents and grandparents were opposed to your plan to teach yourself at home and start a new business.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        They are very worried, so I convinced the head of my school. They respect the head of my school. When she said it’s OK, they believe it’s OK.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Headmaster told your dad and mom that you were ok.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Was they very, you said anxious, worried, but were they very understanding to your decision?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think what they did at the time is make sure that I can continue to learn without feeling alone, without being isolated.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        When the head of the school said it’s OK, you don’t have to worry about legal issues, what they did is that they suggested their professors because my place, my home, is close to the National Chengchi University, NCCU, and both my parents got their undergraduate and master’s degree from that university. They are literally my alum.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        They suggested the professors they like when they were students. Some professors were still teaching at the NCCU, so I attended the class of the professors without getting a diploma because they trust their professor. When Professor [Mandarin] said that it’s OK, Audrey can come to my class without having a degree, then my parents are less worried because they have also attended his class.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        so you got through with a practical way and you yourself cultivated your way.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes.

                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Good. I think you always get closed to the socially vulnerable and the minority. How do you think you have developed this perspective? From your own experience?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yes. Of course it’s from my own experience. Before I get the heart surgery when I was 12, I cannot run. When I was even younger, I cannot even get angry or upset because my heart condition.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        From your heart?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah. Because of that, I’m very vulnerable physically. After I got the surgery, I also spent a year or so recovering from the surgery. I was handicapped for the first 13 years of my life. That gives me a personal experience on being vulnerable.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Thank you. When you were in school before you become 14, did you feel any stress or find any difficulty to get along with your friends because you were hyper intelligent and maybe you’re different from others?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I attended three kindergarten, six primary school, and one year of high school. For 10 years, I changed to 10 schools. Every school, I only stay for one year. The main stress is really just to get to know my classmates because every year I’m a newcomer to the class.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Did they say any bad things to you because you are different I think from other ordinary children?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course young people when they are vey young, like when I was eight years old, the people who want to work with me already say that I’m a little bit like an adult, like I’m an adult in an eight-year-old class. It, of course, creates some difficulty. Then I just spend more time with adults, so that’s OK.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Akiko Kamimura">
                    <p>
                        Ok, so you are not afraid of being different from others.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I’m not that different when I was eight years old from an 18 year old. If I spent a lot of time with people who are 15, or 16, or 18, then I don’t feel different. We talk about the same topic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I was 15 when I quit high school, I attended the class. It’s usually graduate-level class, so again, people are 10 years older than me. I feel very comfortable with the 25-year-old people.

                    <p>
                        The reason why I asked about these kind of questions, there is pressure to conform for Japanese children. So children rarely say how they truly think and try to be the same, same too. I’m wondering if the same things are happening in Taiwanese society?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Usually, yes. Usually, yes, but we now for the past 10 year or so have the experimental education acts that enable people who want to try different generation cross-discipline or different curriculum, they can apply. Up to 10 percent of Taiwanese student can apply for alternative education.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Good. Sounds really good. You said you couldn’t express your feeling, and it was very stressful. Now what makes you feel stressed, I wonder? You look always happy and you are yourself. Any stressful things are there?

                        It’s very helpful both in the sense of I don’t put my parents in danger from the police, but also in the sense that I think career public servants are the most innovative people. I still think so because the head of school is so innovative. She can even convince my parents. I really like public-sector innovation. That has a lifetime impact on me.

I can be the person that just makes sure the right people get the ball at the right time. In that sense, yes, I don’t have this individual competition idea. It’s always the right people, like the power who make the map. When he gets the ball, I make sure he gets all the support he needs.

                        The main required ability is to listen. I don’t just mean hearing as in listen. I mean, to empathize with other people because people all have unique perspectives. If you cannot empathize with one another, then it just seems like differences. If you can empathize with one another, then the common purpose will appear. You can all learn together. Empathy is the way to discover shared common purpose.

If I am in your shoes, how will I make life better? I can share it with you. I’m not just crying with you, but I can empathize and think about your side of things.

                        Good example like the touchscreen making things change. According to one survey, there are a few children in Japan who think they can change Japanese society. Regarding to the future of Japan, their pessimism is very strong and having reasons such as anxiety about finance, social security, the economy and employment, blah-blah-blah. How can we encourage children with their pessimistic fears?

                        If you are pessimistic or if you are depressed, it means that you can think in the whole picture. It’s not necessarily a bad thing. People who are very excited or very optimistic tend to focus only on the thing that excites them. One needs to practice both sides. It’s like a pendulum.

                        Sometime you are more excited than you can create more, but sometimes you are more depressed. That means that you can learn more. Both sides need to happen. For me, for example, I will create during the day. When I was alone and sleeping, I’m usually in a very depressed state, meaning that I don’t want to do anything. I just make the information in my mind work with themself, and I don’t make judgments.

                        One thing about being pessimistic or depressed is that you don’t make judgments at that time. Only when people are excited and focused will they say, “This is good, I will chase it.” If you are depressed or pessimistic, you wouldn’t say something like that.

                        When that happens, this is the best time to take all the sides and listen to other people’s stories. If people make complaints, for example, and you feel their pain, then you can practice empathy, and before long, your empathy will lead you to create something to make the situation better. It’s pessimism through empathy into the joy of co-creation, and this is how this pendulum swings.

Then, after five minutes, sometime you will say, “Um, do you mean this?” or something, so you check you have correctly understood my words.

                    <p>
                        I’m wondering, if Taiwanese children are more free or allowed to think about many things compared to Japanese children? I think Japanese child seems to be more pressured in…

                    <p>
                        To do a lot, yeah.

                        Taiwanese parents are being changed?

                    <p>
                        Yeah, they are more comfortable to have their children, especially young children, to just enjoy and do nothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        How about the education system? Do many parents want their children to go to a good university or…?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, but if you are enjoying what you are doing, you will learn very quickly. It is better for your academic record, because now at the university don’t really test memorization anymore – anyone with a smartphone can remember things perfectly.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Most university now test your problem-solving capability, how you work together as a team, and things like that. For that, if you are not enjoying what you’re doing, difficult to learn that.

                    <p>
                        It’s good. Still, Japanese university want to check our memory [laughs] or knowledge.

                        Soon, I think AI, assistive intelligence, will make it not very useful.
