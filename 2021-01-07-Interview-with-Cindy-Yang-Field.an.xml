                    <p>
                        Hi, Audrey. Tell us about yourself and your connection in Taiwan.

                    <p>
                        Hi. I’m Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Digital Minister in charge of social innovation, open government, and also youth engagement. I was born in Taiwan in 1981. Nowadays, I’m in charge of the national action plan of the Taiwan open government effort, upon which of course we fought the pandemic off with narrow lockdowns and also fought the infodemic off with no take-downs.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We have this campaign called #TaiwanCanHelp, where we share this Tai model with our international friends.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        I was just learning from you that #TaiwanCanHelp, I thought it was driven by the government and the President Tsai led that donation of masks to other countries. It turns out, you were saying, the citizens got involved, too?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right. In social innovation, we say “It’s everyone’s business with everyone’s help.” Of course, President Tsai Ing-wen did donate a lot of mask, but so did more than 700,000 citizens, which dedicated more than seven million medical masks out of their rationing because we are still rationing out masks – every two weeks is 10, whether you are adult or a child nowadays.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        If you have plenty of masks at home and you don’t collect your ration mask, you can actually dedicate it using a very easy-to-use app, the National Health Insurance app, to dedicate for international humanitarian aid.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You can check out the full list of citizens that participated in it in this website, taiwancanhelp.us, which is not from the government but rather from Aaron Nieh, and Adi, and other YouTubers.

                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        I know Adi from Adi Speaks English. I didn’t know there’s so many facets to this. I love the community.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        You were part of the Sunflower Movement. Can you share with the audience what was happening during that time and how you got involved?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sure. It was a pretty large demonstration with half a million people on the street at one time and many more online. The trigger point was a trade deal with Beijing. It’s called the Cross-Strait Service and Trade Agreement or CSSTA, which was being passed by the parliament without substantial deliberation.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Now, the people who occupy the parliament – many of them are young students – started their own deliberation. It’s a demonstration in a sense of demo, not in a sense of a protest or a riot. I was involved by providing essentially live streaming technical service to not only the people who occupied the parliament but also along with many other people in the community, all the different NGOs that help occupied the parliament.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        There were more than 20 of them, each deliberating a different aspect of the CSSTA. There’s NGOs focusing on human rights, on labor rights, environmental issues. There’s even one focusing on our then new 4G infrastructure or whether we need to allow the PRC – that’s People’s Republic of China – regime components in our 4G network. Nowadays, everybody else is talking about this.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We were discussing that in 2014 and reached a rough consensus saying, “No to this PRC component,” and so it was a very happening time. The main lesson is that half-a-million people on the street can actually agree on something. The occupy was civic chain.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        Wow. Was it the first demonstration you are part of?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        No. Actually, I think not even two weeks before the Sunflower, there was another very large parade in a protest of then-new fourth nuclear plant. We were also there to provide broadband communication.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I remember it was raining very hard that day. Their turnout, like people who could actually walk to the end of the parade is arguably smaller than what the organizers imagined. Many people still care about this issue, so they watch live-streaming.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Now, in early 2014, live-streaming is very much a new phenomenon. People really want to feel that they were there. We also help setting up the live-streaming technologies for those demonstrators.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a self-proclaimed anarchist, which…

                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        Oh, conservative anarchist. The Internet definition [laughs] is to be free from governing body. I am curious, and I know a lot of people have been curious, why did you choose to become a government official?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Sure. A common survey, a lowercase minister, meaning that I mostly create common values out of different positions, but I never gave a single order as a minister. Neither did I take order from anyone.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        By voluntary association, people learn to see that it’s not just about a top-down, lockdown, takedown, shutdown way of governance when it comes to the pandemic or the infodemic.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Maybe the Internet norms, which is a very Taoist norm, which is we call a rough consensus and running code, essentially, is a superior model to tackle this very complicated problems because otherwise people do not have a good first-hand experience on why to wear a mask, wash your hands, and things like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The only way to do that is not to impose very heavy fines, but rather to explain the science, and then come up with very cute dog memes that says, “Wear a mask to protect yourself against your own unwashed hands,” and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Once that idea was spreading, spread to sufficient amount of people, you do not need a top-down order and people will wear a mask all the time to protect their own face from their own hands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If your title wasn’t minister, what title would you give yourself that’s fitting?
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        No, I call myself a lowercase minister, so I’m fine with…If you go to digitalminister.tw, you go to my page. The lowercase means that I mostly just listen to people and give such advice, but I do not give people orders and I don’t take orders either. That was the point.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        I noticed that somewhere, it says, “Without an office,” as well.

                        That’s right. I have, of course, this place where we’re recording this podcast in, but most of the time, if I’m not touring Taiwan, I’m in the Social Innovation Lab, which is in the heart of Taipei City. It’s a park. We tore down the walls, so anyone can walk in and enjoy any of those 17 sustainable development goals, related activities and events, and food, and things like that.

                        This is the mayor of Prague City and ZdenÃÂk HÃÂib. We also have a lot of communications with people around Taiwan. I tour around Taiwan during the Social Innovation tours, and I talk with the local people while connecting through two-way telepresence to the 12 different ministries, people in the Social Innovation Lab.

                        Just by going to the Social Innovation Lab, they can connect to all the different Social Innovation units around Taiwan and participate in a face-to-face-ish meeting with the local community and local people to make sure that there is sufficient bandwidth both ways to make an account of all the related policies and so on and so forth.

                        For example, co-ops social entrepreneurs, people who are in the local but have a good idea that’s worth spreading, this makes it possible for them to reach the central government very quickly and in a very uncompressed form.

                        No, they’re not. They are, at any given time, maybe 30, 40 different teams working on any of the SDG goals or start-ups and things like that. It’s like a small incubator, but anyone can also run events there.

                        In a lot of the talks and tours you’ve given, you’ve talked about the importance of trust for building democracy. How do you help citizens trust our government?

                        [laughs] The citizens are free to trust anyone, and we’re not interfering with that. When we talk about social innovation, the public service need to trust the citizens.

                    <p>
                        For example, when we were rationing out the masks – as I mentioned before, nowadays, it’s 10 per two weeks – we wanted a way for people to trust each other and for the government officials to trust that there is nobody stockpiling or holding the masks and so on.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It just so happens that there was a person named Howard Wu from Tainan City who invented this map which you can see the live availability of medical mask in each and every store. Colored green if there is still some in stock and colored red if it’s almost gone.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You don’t have to queue in vain. You can go straight to the pharmacy or convenience store that still have some masks. Imagine if it relied, as it did initially, in the beginning of February, on the citizens’ input on crowdsourcing, then the numbers may be accurate, it may be inaccurate. The trustworthiness will fluctuate, depending on the availability of volunteers.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I talked then to the head of Cabinet, to the premier, who talked to the National Health Insurance Agency. We dedicated, through open data, every 30 seconds, an update of the real-time availability of the pharmacies’ medical mask stock and published it as an open API to Howard Wu and many other civic technologists.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Because of that, when you’re queuing in line, you can check, in real time, the person queuing before you, how many masks did they actually buy. The pharmacists have a lot of trustworthiness, because they keep the system running, but so did anyone who procure some mask from the nearby pharmacy, because they are, in essence, part of the national auditing team.

                    <p>
                        It’s participatory accountability. This is what I mean by trusting the citizens with open data and API.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Cindy Yang Field">
                    <p>
                        That’s such a great example of obviously using technology to solve COVID issues, but also government and citizens working together, in my opinion, to provide data, which is mask availability and distribution. That’s so important to both parties.

                        I talked a little bit about rationing with the fairness part, but the fun part is also very important. We have a national spokesdog of the Central Epidemic Command Center. The name is Zongchai.

                        It’s a Shiba Inu, very cute. The Zongchai is, as you can see here, reminding you to buy some masks. “But why would you buy some mask? Well, a mask protects you against your own hands. Wash your hands frequently.”

                        This is a very good message, because it doesn’t appeal to altruistic intentions. This appeals only to rational self-interest, like, “Why wouldn’t you want to protect against your own hands?” This also makes this very easy to spread and really, because it’s very cute.

                        Also, of course, and rightly so, attributed the main reason why Taiwan did so well is that we acted pretty much before anyone else. We acted last January, so that’s one year ago. On the 1st of January, we already started house inspections for flight passengers coming in from Wuhan.

                        Taiwan, unlike pretty much any other Asian jurisdiction, nowadays, Uber operates legally as a local fleet, the Q Taxi. There’s also LINE Taxi. There’s also, of course, other taxi fleets that use the Uber model of essentially app-based hailing, not hailing on the street.

                        There was a young boy who called, I think, mid-April last year saying that, “You’re rationing mask, and all I get is pink medical masks. Other boy classmates of mine wear blue, and I have pink only. I don’t want to go to school, and/or I don’t want to wear a mask. Do something about it.”

                        The very next day, on the daily 2:00 PM press conference, all the medical officers wear pink. Minister Chen Shih-chung even said Pink Panther was his childhood hero. Suddenly, the boy became the most hip boy in the class for only he had the color that the heroes wear and also the hero of heroes wear.

                        That’s a great story of gender mainstreaming because it flipped the color around. A lot of brands just started calling themselves pink. That is responsive governance. Regardless of how long is your democratic institution’s tradition, you can take a page from this.

                        Yeah. Wow. One thing I want to ask you around the assumption of Taiwan’s success is a lot of people think it’s because of its smaller size. In some interviews, people have asked you about that as well. “Can what’s been done in Taiwan scale?” is the question people have asked. What do you think of size?

                        Taiwan only seems small because we have broadband as a human right. No matter where you are in Taiwan, you’re guaranteed to have 10 megabits per second for just $15 per month for unlimited data connection both ways. Otherwise, it’s my fault personally.

                    <p>
                        This then guarantees that any point in Taiwan can access the digital service that I just illustrated. It also feels much more close because anyone can start a two-way video conferencing without worrying about their bandwidth cost and without worrying about whether they have a WiFi connection or not. That makes Taiwan seem small even though we’re actually 24 million people.

                        Last year was the first time that we had a transgender pride next to the LGBTQ pride in general. That helps the visibility. Also, the marriage equality law helps.

                        When legalizing marriage equality, we say we legalize the bylaws but not the in-laws.

                        When two same-sex couple wed, their families do not wed. This is a really good intergenerational solution.

                        Like all the best social innovations, it takes where it had tension and then, like the Eurasian Plate bumping into the Philippines Sea Plate or the other way around which cause earthquakes, it also caused the Jade Mountain — or Saviah, Yushan — to raise. It rises about two-and-a-half centimeters per year.

                        This higher vantage point like legalizing the marriage by marrying the bylaws but not the in-laws, it created a new vantage point. I like to call it the up-wing direction that makes the generations closer to each other by respecting their own positions and each other’s positions while creating new values. That will also help everybody to be more accepting toward everybody else.

                        That was a poetic description. I’ll leave you with, we just entered 2021, what are you most looking forward to either achieving or the impact that you could have this year?

                        Of course, I look forward to assist the vaccination. There’s some really good sign. Not only is the domestic vaccination research and development going quite well, but also the AstraZeneca procurement seems to be quite successful.

                        What’s more is that around the end of last year there’s record number of people who volunteered to vaccinate against the seasonal flu, which means that there’s a lot of people waiting very eagerly to get vaccinated. I’ll probably do whatever I can help to make sure that experience of getting vaccinated is smooth and also secure.
